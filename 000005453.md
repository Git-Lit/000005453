  INTRODUCTION.

Besides the intrinsic value ofthe information afforded
in the following narrative, it derives further interest
from relating to a part of the world with which we
are so little acquainted. It is to be regretted that
the author has not always mentioned his authorities
for the interesting facts whicii he has stated respecting
those islands of the Archipelago which he did not
personally visit, and, should this work reach a second
edition in America, it is to be hoped that the
desideratum will be supplied.


There is a slight difference between this edition of
the work and that which has been published in
America; some obscure expressions having been
omitted, and a few words, more commonly employed
by American authors than by those of this country,
having been changed into those synonymes with
which the ear of an English reader is more familiar.


The principal places visited by Mr. Abeel were
Canton, Macao, Batavia, Singapore, Malacca, and
Bankok, each of which affords a wide sphere of
missionary exertion. A few statistical details,
illustrative of their civil and religious condition, may
<!-- Leaf 12, Page: VI -->
contribute to the interest of his narrative, and prove
acceptable to the reader: to which may be added a
short notice of Penang, as one of the chief spheres
of British Missionary effort in that part of the world.


Canton and Macao.—The unbridled insolence
of the local government at Canton, towards all
foreigners, has imparted to the population generally
a contempt for Europeans which is not found among
the inhabitants of either of the other maritime
provinces *. This circumstance renders Canton a less
promising field of labour than, from the amount of
its population and the extent of its trade, it otherwise
would be.


The jealousy of the Portuguese Government of
Macao circumscribes the efforts of a missionary there
also; and, to the day of his lamented death, Dr.
Morrison had little opportunity of preaching the
Gospel openly to the Chinese: yet his invaluable
labours have prepared the way for all future
missionaries to the Chinese empire. By his two great
works, the Translation of the Bible into the Chinese
Language, and his English and Chinese Dictionary,
together with the Grammar which he formed, he has
rendered that language easily accessible to every
student, has materially abridged the term during
which a missionary to that country must be content
to learn rather than to teach, and has provided the  
  
  
  * See Voyage of the Amherst, pp. 3t—35, &c.
<!-- Leaf 13, Page: VII -->
missionary body with the very best means of
communicating instruction to that reading people.


The existence of a small church at Canton,
likewise, proves that the Lord still works, according to
His promise, with the ministers of His Gospel *.
The Chinese converts who have made a Christian
profession by baptism, assemble every Sabbath for
Divine worship, under the care of Leang Asa, who
has for some years given himself to the work of the
ministry. Le Asin, a young convert, begins to be
useful to his countrymen—Choo-Sean-Sang calls his
family to join him in prayer, and reads with them the
Scriptures—Agong, one of the converts, distributes
Christian tracts among his heathen connexions—and
Leang Asa is indefatigable in his ministry f.


In May 1830, with another Chinese Christian, he
travelled into the interior, distributing Chinese books
in the towns and villages. On the 11th of June he
entered the town of Kaou-Chow-Foo, a hundred and
twenty miles distant fromCanton,accompanied by three
porters, who carried his Christian books. It was the
day of the examination of the candidates for literary
honours from all the adjacent country. Leang Asa
distributed his books among the students who came
to the examination, remained in the place till July,
and then returned to Canton J. In October, 1833, a

| Missionary Annual for 1834, p. 117.
<!-- Leaf 14, Page: VIII -->
similar meeting was held in this city for the district
of Kwang-Chow-Foo. On this occasion Leang Asa
and two of his friends distributed the Scriptures and
religious tracts to multitudes of the literary
candidates, some of whom had come from towns and
villages a hundred miles distant. The books were given
publicly, and were eagerly received. Some even
returned to beg for more *.


The ministry of Leang Asa is rendered the more
interesting by the-fact that soon after the
commencement of his Christian labours he was called to endure
persecution. Having written an essay entitled " The
True Principles of the World's Salvation," he printed
at Canton a hundred copies for distribution. Before,
however, he was able to distribute them, the blocks
and the books were seized by the Police. He was
then apprehended himself, and thus describes the
treatment which he received from the authorities :—
\"I was brought before a Mandarin for trial, who told
me that my books about Jesus, and my believing in the
doctrines of Jesus, were a violation of the law. After
trial, I was put into a guard-room; yet, while there,
I thought to myself, ■ This is a book of the true
doctrine of Jesus, the Saviour of the world, which
exhorts men to turn from vice and become o*ood :
why should I be persecuted ?' I afterwards induced
the Minister (Dr. Morrison) to interest persons to
speak to the Mandarin on my behalf, and to liberate  
  
  
  * Fortieth Report of the London Missionary Society.
<!-- Leaf 15, Page: IX -->
me. At length they listened to my friends, and, after
giving me thirty blows with the bamboo, and beating
the soles of my feet till the blood flowed, I was
liberated. To suffer thus was hard; and, besides this,
the mandarins and police-officers extorted from me
seventy dollars. But, after I had suffered persecution
and loss of property, I did not presume to turn my
back on the Lord Jesus Christ, and the great mercy
of his redeeming love and merits, but accounted
myself a sinner, suffering the punishment due to sin *."
Since that time he has only been more zealous in the
cause of Christ.


Though the Mission has lost, by the death of Dr.
Morrison, an experienced, prudent, and devoted head,
yet Leang Asa is still sustained by the friendship and
counsel of the two missionaries from the American
Board of Missions, Mr. Bridgman and Dr. Parkers.


Java.—Nearly the whole of this island is subject
to the King of Holland. Throughout the whole of
the Dutch territory there are Chinese settlers, most
inadequately provided with missionary instruction.
The Dutch Governors have been successively
favourable to the labours of Mr. Medhurst, the missionary
of the London Society, stationed at Batavia. The
mission is of slow growth; but Mr. Medhurst has
surmounted many discouragements, and does the

work of an evangelist with intelligence, assiduity,
and zeal. He has two assistants,—Mr. Young, an
European; and Lucas Mouton, a native Christian.
There are eight services during the week, attended,
when the different congregations are reckoned
together, by about five hundred persons, European, Malay,
and Chinese. Of these about a hundred and twenty
are native Christians. Six natives of Celebes,
resident at Batavia, were baptized in the year 1833, and
twelve more were desirous of receiving that ordinance.
Six native Christians have been admitted to the
Lord's Table, and six more have professed their desire
to join them. The European communicants are nine-.
In a neighbouring place, visited by Mr. Medhurst,
and without a missionary, there are sixty
communicants. Two Chinese schools, attached to the
mission, contain forty children. There is an English day
school consisting of thirty children; and a European
orphan school, of fifteen orphans, has lately been
placed under his superintendence. The missionary
press is in active operation, and the books and tracts
distributed in the year 1833 amounted to 18,092*.


Malacca, Penang, and Singapore, as British
settlements, are still more interesting to the English
reader. They have all risen rapidly in population and
importance since their connexion with England.  
  
  
  * Fortieth Report of the London Missionary Society.
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: XI -->
  
  Malacca was ceded to the British by the Dutch

in 1825. The town is situated in N. Lat. 2 deg. 14
min., and E. Long. 102 deg. 12 min. The territory
extends about forty miles along the coast, and about
thirty miles inland; containing an area of eight
hundred square miles. The interior is mountainous;
the climate healthy; and the thermometer ranges from

72 deg. to 85 deg. throughout the year.  
  
  
  In 1815 the population was 16,876; in 1817,

19,627; in 1822,22,000; and, by the latest return
at the India-House, it now amounts to 34,606. Of
these 34,606 persons, 22,874 are Malays and Bugis,
4,748 Chinese, and 229 Europeans, or of European
descent. The rest are Siamese, Battas, Arabs,Hindoos, Sepoys, Indo-Portuguese, &c. &c.  
  
  
  As the experiment of Chinese female schools has

been chiefly tried at Malacca, it may be interesting
to the reader to see the following analysis of the

  At this settlement there has been a mission of the

London Missionary Society since the year 1815, when
it was commenced by Dr. Milne. In 1816 Dr.  
  
  
  * Martin's History of the Colonies, vol. i. p. 422, &c
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: XII -->
Morrison and Dr, Milne founded the Anglo-Chinese
College, to the erection of which Dr. Morrison gave
1000/. with an annual subscription of 100/. for five
years. It was designed to facilitate the acquisition
of the English language and of European literature^
by Chinese students, and to help European students
in the study of the Chinese language and literature.
It is open to European students of every religious
denomination, as well as to Chinese; and at the time
of the latest accounts there were thirty students.
The two missionaries of the station are Mr. Hughes
and Mr. Evans.


The last accounts of the schools, published by the
London Missionary Society, state that there were
then four schools for Chinese boys. Besides these,
there were five schools for Chinese girls,
flourishing under the superintendence of Miss Wallace.
That lady has since accepted the invitation of some
American merchants at Canton, to become their agent
in promoting female education in Siam; but the
Society for promoting Female Education in the East
(a Society which is calculated to afford most useful
assistance to the Missions in India and the Eastern
Archipelago, and eventually, should China admit of
Protestant exertion, to those which may be planted
in that empire) is preparing to send out another lady,
to take the place which she has left vacant. Besides
the Chinese schools, there are four others for Malay
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: XIII -->
children, and the whole number of children under
Christian instruction is five hundred*.


Penang.—Penang, a picturesque island, situated
about N. Lat. 5 deg. and E. Long. 100 deg., contains
about a hundred and sixty square miles; its greatest
length being sixteen miles, and its greatest breadth
twelve. Though the central region is mountainous,
the island is generally fertile, clothed with luxuriant
wood or rich vegetation. Georgetown, the capital,
is situated within a capacious harbour with good
anchorage, on the East coast. It is a neat and
wellbuilt town, of which the principal shopkeepers are
Chinese. The climate is healthy, and the thermometer
ranges from 76 to 90 degrees. When the island
came into the possession of the East-India Company,
in 1786, a few miserable Malay fishermen were the
only tenants : at present the inhabitants amount to
"33,560, of whom 500 are Europeans, and 8989
Chinese f.


In 1819 Messrs. Beighton and Ince were sent
thither by the London Missionary Society; Mr.
Beighton as missionary to the Malays, and Mr. Ince
to the Chinese. Mr. Beighton continues his useful
labours to this clay. Mr. Ince, a valuable and devoted
inissionary,died in April 1825, and has been succeeded
by Mr. Dyer. There are six Malay schools, in which  
  
  
  * Fortieth Report of the London Missionary Society.
f Martin, vol. i. p. 411,&c.
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: XIV -->
two hundred and six children are taught, of whom
forty-three are girls; and four Chinese schools, in
which there are twenty-three boys and thirty-two
girls. To the support of these schools the
Government contributes thirty dollars monthly. A mission
chapel has been built. There is a mission press,
and many Christian books have been circulated.
Thirteen natives have been admitted into the Christian
church by baptism; and the English congregation
consists of about seventy, of whom nine are
communicants*.


Singapore.—The island of Singapore is situated
between 1 and 2 degrees N. Lat. and between 103
and 104 degrees E. Long. It has an area of two
hundred and seventy square miles; its greatest length
being about twenty-seven miles from east to west,
and its greatest breadth fifteen. It is still generally
covered with jungle, being at the same time low and
marshy: yet the town has proved healthy. The
thermometer ranges from 71 to 89 degrees. The
settlement was finally ceded to the British in 1825,
by the Dutch, and by the Malay Princes of the
opposite coast of the Peninsula.


When the settlement was formed, in 1818, there
were only 150 Malay fishermen on the island. By
the census of 1833 the population had then amounted  
  
  
  * Fortieth Report of the London Missionary Society.
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: XV -->
to 20,917: the Europeans being 119, the
IndoBritons 96, the Malays 7131, the Chinese 8517 (of
which the males were 7650, the females 867), and
the remainder were Armenians, Arabs, Hindoos,
Bugis, Javanese, &c. &c. The town consists
generally of stone houses, two stories high. *' On the
east side of the harbour, enterprising British
merchants are erecting substantial and ornamental houses
fronting the sea. The ground is generally raised
three feet; and the mansions have a superb entrance,
by an ascent of granite stairs; then an elegant
portico, supported by magnificent Grecian columns :
the rooms are lofty, with Venetian windows down to
the floor, and furnished in a luxurious manner; each
tenement provided with its baths, billiard-tables, &c.;
while the grounds are tastily laid out with shrubs of
beautiful foliage*."


The leading merchants, agents, shopkeepers, and
auctioneers, are Englishmen. There are several
wealthy Chinese merchants; and the bulk of the
shopkeepers, and the most valuable part of the citizens,
are Chinese, nearly 5000 of whom arrive annually
from China by the yearly trading j unks. About 1000
remain at Singapore, and the remainder disperse
themselves over the neighbouring islandsf. Besides
these junks from China, about twenty-six Chinese
junks come from Cochin-China, Cambodjia, and  
  
  
  * Martin, vol i. p. 427, &c. + Ibid. p. 432.
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: XVI -->
Hainan*. From May 1830 to May 1831, thirty-six
others entered the port from Siamf. Indeed,
Singapore is the emporium of a trade with the whole
Eastern Archipelago. At one part of the year, a
hundred and forty native vessels have been observed
to come in monthly from forty difterentports of Borneo,
Celebes, the Moluccas, Sumatra, China,
CochinChina, Siam, and Malayala J. Altogether, the
settlement exports goods to the amount of 3,000,000/.
sterling §.


There is a mission chapel and printing press. An
immense distribution has been made of Christian
books, both among the heathen population of the
settlement and among the Chinese sailors, who
receive them eagerly. In 1832 there were three Chinese
schools—two for boys, who were taught in the Canton
and Fuhkeen dialects; and one for girls. This last
was then under the superintendence of Miss Martyn;
but as that lady has since married, the native female
schools are now without a superintendant. The
mission has suffered much by the sickness of the


* Martin, vol.i. p. 439. The island of Hainan, which must not
be confounded with Ilainam, a small island in the Canton River
(mentioned at p. 70 of this journal), invites the serious attention of
Missionary Societies. The inhabitants, who are chiefly descended
from Fuhkien emigrants, are cheerful, kind, friendly, clean, and
industrious. Mr. Gutzlaff saw many of them at Bankok : they
willingly conversed upon the subject of religion, eagerly read the
Christian books which he gave them, -and some of them invited
him to visit their country.— Gutzlaff's Voyages, pp. 82 83.

missionaries; and the labours of the present
missionary, Mr. Thomsen, were, at the time of the last
report, much restricted by debility *.


Siam.—The kingdom of Siam is an important
sphere for missionary labour, not merely from the
amount of its population, but also from its extensive
intercourse with China. This empire has 2,790,500
inhabitants of different nations, of which 401,300
form the population of Bankok, the capital *f*. The
Singapore Chronicle thus describes the capacities of
the country:—" The tea-tree grows as luxuriantly
here as in China. The silk-worm, too, abounds—
also the mulberry-tree—all wild.... In this country
there must be mines of silver and gold; of silver, it
is evident, for several told us that in the rainy season,
when the ground is drenched, pieces of silver are
found as large as a tickal. Indigo, too, is luxuriant;
so also is the coffee plant. The fruits all grow wild;
still they are much finer and more numerous than I
have met with elsewhere.... Of the mangoes there are
thirty species, most delicious. Several species of the
mangosteen, oranges, &c. abound—all wild. In fact,
this exuberant country, in the hands of Europeans,
might become a perfect Paradise, and a mart for half
the world. Cotton is plentiful, and as fine as silk;
it is short, but it is wild The country is quiet, the

<!-- Leaf 24, Page: XVIII -->
productions are abundant, and the river at Bankok
crowded with Chinese junks*." Hence it has
attracted many Chinese settlers. Of the 401,300
inhabitants of Bankok, 310,000 are Chinese, 50,000
more are of Chinese origin; and about eighty junks
arrive annually from the different ports of Chinas.


In August 1828 Mr. Gutzlaff first visited that
capital, and staid there for some months. In the
beginning of 1830 he paid it a second missionary
visit. There, in February 1831; Mrs. Gutzlaff was
called to her eternal home, but not before she had
prepared for the press a dictionary of the Annam
language, a Chinese tract, and an English and
Chinese dictionary. Meanwhile Mr. Gutzlaff had
compiled an English and Siamese dictionary, and had
translated the New Testament into Siamese. This
work, which is read with ease, and understood by
natives of all ranks, is now printing at Malacca J.


Since Mr. Abeel's departure from Bankok, the
American Board of Missions have appointed Messrs.
Robinson and Johnson, with Dr. Bradley, M.D.,
missionaries to that place. These gentlemen reached
Singapore in the autumn of 1833, and entered on the
study of the Chinese language §. Miss Wallace also
has consented to undertake the superintendence of
the female schools of the Siamese mission.

<!-- Leaf 25, Page: XIX -->
  
  From these slight notices it may sufficiently appear

that in each of these places there is enough for the
missionary to do. But these are not the only
settlements of the Chinese in the Eastern Archipelago.
By the last census, in 1825, which is with good
reason thought rather to underrate the amount of the
population, China Proper, exclusive of Tartary and
of the colonies, is said to contain 352,866,012
inhabitants *. This number gives a population of 288
to the square mile; rather more crowded than that of
England, and rather less so than that of Ireland; the
former being 257 to the square mile, and the latter
292. Hence the emigration from China, as from
England and Ireland, is very considerable.
Thousands annually leave the maritime provinces, Canton,
Fuhkeen, Chekeang, and Keangnan, to settle in the
Archipelago; and the colonial settlers are already
numerous : Mr. Crawford, the late Resident atSingapore, has estimated the numbers to be as follows

Philippine Islands 15,000 Penang 8,500
Borneo 120,000 Malayala 40,000
Java 45,000 Siam 440,000
Rhio 18,000 Cochin-China. 15,000
Singapore 6,200 Tonquin 25,000
Malacca 2,000 Total 734,700s

Many of these colonists return to China %—whence
it appears, that, should any of them be brought to the
knowledge of Christ, they may become missionaries  
  
  
  * Martin, vol. i. p. 447. t Ibid. p. 450.
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: XX -->
tIbidto their own country; and thus China may be
indirectly evangelized, even though foreigners should
continue to be rigidly excluded from her shores. The
Missionary Leang Asa received the knowledge of the
truth while resident at Malacca.


Mr. Abeel, however, in this work, expresses an
opinion that China itself may be entered by European
missionaries. Mr. Gutzlaff has certainly spent whole
months in the maritime provinces of that empire,
making long excursions among the villages, freely
conversing with the people, and distributing
thousands of Christian books to persons eager to receive
and read them. He is persuaded that other
missionaries might do the same. And while he is
himself meditating a journey "through the whole
of Central China, up to Thibet and Bengal," he says
that another German, who has joined the Chinese
mission, may possibly settle in one of the northern
provinces *. That which has apparently most
contributed, under God, to his success hitherto, has been
his perfect acquaintance with different dialects of
the Chinese language, his familiarity with their most
esteemed classical authors, and his knowledge of
medicine. Any one possessed of these qualifications,
with equal faith and equal kindness, might in all
probability safely follow his steps.


May God, in mercy to that empire, raise up suitable
agents for this great work ! And, if we may judge by  
  
  
  * Missionary Register, Feb. 1835, pp. 86, 87.
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: XXI -->
the repeated experience of Mr. Gutzlaff along the
whole Chinese coast, they may make the medical
dispensary a better protection than the presence of a
British seventy-four, and the affections of the people
will be more than a substitute for the patronage of
the Emperor. How much, apparently, of the future
welfare of China, depends upon a few Christian men
being now found, who, uniting capacity, courage,
and devoted zeal, with prudence and gentleness,
may perseveringly attempt to plant missions along
her coasts. May the " Lord of the harvest send
forth labourers into his harvest"—constrain the
despotic rulers of the land to favour them—and, beyond
all our anticipations, guide that immense people to
the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ!

  PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR.

The writer of the following pages went to Canton
under the auspices of the American Seaman's Friend
Society, to act as Chaplain to seamen and foreign
residents speaking the English language. He took
with him aconditional appointment from the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, in
case he should consider it his duty to devote himself
exclusively to the Heathen. At the expiration of the
first year he left China on a tour to some of the
islands and continental kingdoms of South-eastern
Asia, with the double purpose of ascertaining the
most important posts for Missions, and of rendering
himself useful in that station which presented the
strongest claims upon his services.


As the object of this volume is to inform the
Christian AVorld of the state of these Heathen
countries, the writer has extended his observations
much beyond the limits of his travels, and has drawn
from every open and uncorrupted source the
information required for his purpose. What he has seen,
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: XXX -->
and heard, and read, as far as the testimony appeared
credible, has been freely appropriated. A
considerable portion of what is stated has been derived from
the experience and observation of his
fellow-missionaries resident at the places which he visited. Of
them he has said as little as possible; both because
their names are too few not to be known, and because
it is doubtful whether any eulogies from one of their
number would be of advantage to themselves, or to
the cause in which they are engaged. The same
silence has been preserved with respect to many
families and individuals from whom much kindness
was received, and for whom the highest regard is
cherished.


An interruption of the narrative of events to insert
what appeared worthy of remark, as well as an
introduction of facts the knowledge of which was in a
few instances gained after the date under which they
are recorded, with other discrepancies of the same
kind, would not deserve notice, were it not that they
might be thought to derogate from the correctness of
the observations. It is to be regretted, that many
subjects of the greatest interest have been either
omitted or passed over with a few unsatisfactory
remarks, while others of far less importance have
been inserted in their place. The omission was
unavoidable, owing to a dearth of information on these
points: the less important observations were
substituted, in the hope that they may at least have the
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: XXXI -->
effect of drawing attention to these neglected regions,
and thus lead to measures for their further
investigation and spiritual benefit.


As many deficiencies will be detected in the style
of this work, the writer must state, as an apology,
that it was written under considerable disadvantages
of. circumstances and bodily health, and that the
greater part of it he had neither strength nor leisure
to revise.

  CHAPTER I.  
  
  
  PASSAGE INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO.

On Wednesday the 14th of October, 1829, the Rev.
{empty}E. C. Bridgman and myself bade farewell to our
friends and country, and embarked in the ship Roman,
Capt. Lavender, for Canton, China. The tedium of
the voyage was greatly relieved by the society of four
fellow-passengers, citizens of New-York. Owing
to calms, and a strong opposing current, we were
detained two days within sight of the city.


Early on Friday morning we left our anchorage,
and, with a light though favourable breeze, stood to
sea. The wind freshened as we advanced, and,
between eight and nine o'clock, the return of the pilot
presented the last opportunity of communicating with
the shore.


During the greater part of the passage nothing
occurred which is not generally witnessed, and has
not been frequently detailed. Divine service was
established, from the first, on the morning and
afternoon of the Lord's-day, and social worship every
evening at the change of the watch. As no
com
es o
pulsory measures were employed to gain the
attendW B
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 2 -->
ance of the crew, composed of a heterogeneous
company, the number of worshippers varied with
their fickle inclinations. Nothing proved so effectual
in bringing them together, as frequent visits to the
forecastle, and more private interviews with them,
when disengaged, in their night-watch upon deck.


Nearly three months elapsed on our passage before
we enjoyed a sight of land. The first stable object
p,vhich changed for a moment our wearisome
prospect, was the small island of St. Paul. It is
remarkable for a pond, which furnishes to the voyager a
well-stored larder, and a self-cooking kitchen. Fish
of all kinds, which are taken in abundance, may be
thrown from the hook into boiling springs, and thus
prepared for the table without trouble or expense.
The immense distance of this rocky islet, and its
sister Amsterdam, from any continent, is another
peculiarity.


On the 25th of January, Sandal-wood Island, the
first land made in the Eastern passage, was descried.
Before tlie island appeared, its proximity was
indicated by large land birds, resembling* eagles,
majestically sailing in the air above us; and butterflies, or
winged grasshoppers, which, borne on the breeze,
came and lighted upon the ship. The island is
extensive, and produces many valuable articles, though
very little is known of the physical, political, or
moral condition of its inhabitants. No attempts
have been made by Protestant Christians for its
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 3 -->
conversion; none to discover whether, with its
populous neighbours, it is not waiting for God's law.


That the feasibility of establishing missions upon
some, or all, of these islands, might be readily tested,
is evident to those who have sailed almost within hail
of their shores, and whose timidity, or want of zeal,
does not controul a laudable spirit of Christian
enterprize. Our course was through the Ombay passage,
and afforded a view of the islands of Flores, Solor,
Lomblem, Pantar, and Ombay, on the left; and of
Timor, Cambing, Baby, and probably Wetter, on the
right. As may be readily supposed, the greater part
of our time was spent in feasting our eyes upon
the cheering and changing aspects of land, and in
suffering our imagination to expatiate where it would
be more interesting, but perhaps more hazardous, to
roam in person. Since it was not our object to land,
we were by no means grieved to enjoy the coolness
and impetus of a fresh breeze, and soon to leave these
smiling spots to charm the hearts and eyes of our
successors. Numerous huts were distinguished on
the hills of many of these islands. One of our
passengers, on a previous voyage, was becalmed for a
day and a night within a short distance of Ombay.
In addition to the dwellings he could discern by day,
fires, probably for cooking, were lighted in the
evening, which, bespangling the shores and hills of this
and the adjacent islands, indicated a considerable
population.

<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 4 -->

How far the Roman Catholics succeeded in their
early attempts to diffuse their faith through this part
of the Archipelago, or to what extent the trophies
of their ancient zeal may still exist, where commerce
has ceased to allure the European trader, it is quite
impossible to determine.


The Portuguese were probably the first who
attempted the conversion of these islands to nominal
Christianity. They took possession of the colonies
as early as 1510, or soon after, and commenced at the
same time their religious operations; but there is
reason to believe, from authentic records and
existing facts, that their success was by no means
answerable to the latitude of faith and practice
generally admitted by their proselyting policy. Before
the middle of the sixteenth century, the celebrated
Xavier and his coadjutors arrived in these regions, and
displayed (according to the Saint's biographer) those
wonders of super-human wisdom and power by whicii
thousands were forthwith converted to the true faith.
Near the close of the century, the Dutch dispossessed
the Portuguese, and soon afterwards introduced
Protestantism among the natives.


It is said that "one principal purpose of the
formation of the Dutch East-India Company, was the
propagation of Christianity in those countries whicii
should come under their dominion." Had this
purpose actuated the foreign agents of the Company,
and all the early chaplains ofthe establishment as it
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 5 -->
did many of them, the genuine conversion of these
lovely and populous islands had probably been the
result. The natives were not only willing, but
desirous, to become acquainted with the religion professed
by the Dutch. They even requested teachers; and,
when their request was complied with, submitted to
their instructions with the greatest docility and
confidence.


In looking over the records of these times, we are
struck with a number of rather opposing facts and
scarcely know whether to give way to our feelings of
admiration for the Zealand energy of some of the first
chaplains, or of deep regret for their injudicious plans,
and the comparative fruitlessness of their vast labours.
They studied and wrote, they travelled and preached,
they founded churches and opened schools. Such
were the variety and multiplicity of their measures,
such the magnitude and success of their efforts,
that, according to their reports, the devils—the only
acknowledged deities of these regions—soon found
their temples deserted, their rights neglected, and
whole villages and islands alienated from their
alleo*iance. At the close of the seventeenth century
forty thousand natives had enrolled themselves
among the disciples of the Saviour*. But here vve
are compelled to check our admiration, by a
knowledge of the result. A declension soon commenced,


* I have not been able to ascertain the population ofthe islands
at this time.
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 6 -->
and continued with such rapidity, that whole districts
speedily relapsed into their former abominations.
The causes of this decline—or rather of the apparent
conversion of such numbers, who afterwards
apostatized—are various. Many of the chaplains were
opposed, in spirit and conduct, to their worthy
coadjutors; too much stress was laid upon a
knowledge of the technicalities, or a compliance with the
formalities, of Christianity, too little upon the
renovation ofthe heart; professing Christians were preferred
to their heathen neighbours in the distribution of
petty offices under Government, and even a monthly
allowance of rice was served out to those, and those
only, who had received the rite of baptism.


During the eighteenth century we read of very
few attempts to revive the spirit of Christianity, or
even to preserve from extinction " that which
remained, and was ready to die." Many ofthe schools
were kept up, and other means, previously established,
continued; but the labour devolved chiefly upon the
natives, and their qualifications were inadequate to
the work; the churches at home were in a
languishing state, and the few messengers sent out took little
or no interest in the instruction of the heathen. To
determine what amount of good was really effected
by these early missionary efforts, requires a new series
of data, different alike from the contradictory reports
of the times, and the opposing sentiments of later
commentators. That many were translated out of
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 7 -->
darkness into light, who will refuse to believe? that
thousands were self-deluded, or deceived, who can
deny ? When we consider what evidently might have
been effected; and what was, no doubt, the aim of the
devoted men of whom we have spoken; we are grieved
at the consequences. For more than two hundred
years this desert might have bloomed like the garden
of the Lord, and loaded with its fragrance every
breeze which refreshes the vast continent and islands
of south-eastern Asia.


These few historical facts bring us down to our
own times, and may prepare the way for the following
remarks upon the missions ofthe present day, in the
different islands that lay on our course.


The large island of Timor was one of those
included within our view, while passing through the
Ombay passage. Its forest trees, crowning a majestic
bank which skirted the sea, waved us a graceful
invitation to their cooling shades—perhaps to the
relief of the crowds who perish beneath them. Timor
is one of the most extensive and important islands
in these seas. According to the accounts of travellers,
a number of independent and unsocial tribes roam
through its deep interior, who have so little mutual
intercourse, that no less than forty languages are
spoken among them. There are two foreign
establishments upon the island, the one occupied by the
Portuguese, the other by the Dutch. The former is
called Delli, or Didil, and is situated on the
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 8 -->
northeast part of the island. Of its commercial
importance we know but little. More than three centuries
have elapsed since the Roman Catholic religion was
introduced here; and although the Portuguese
colonists and their numerous priests have generally
given it currency in other parts of the East, where
they have preserved a footing, yet Timor has received
but little attention at their hands. One evident
reason, according to a witness of their own nation
and religion, is, because the priests are a
worldlyminded and ungodly set of men. The greater part
of the day they employ in looking after their
speculations in sandal-wood, wax, gold, copper, and the
very heathen themselves, whom they export, and sell
as slaves. This, however, is but a part of their
unchristian conduct.  
  
  
  " By night they practise every sin,
By day their hands draw nigh to God."


The most disgraceful ecclesiastics in Macao are
generally selected for Timor; and cases have occurred
in which lawless offenders of this class, with whom
nothing could be done, have had other punishment
mitigated into missionary banishment to this ill-fated
island. If this be the case—and there is no reason
to doubt the authority upon which it is given—
we see sufficient reason why the petty chiefs who
have embraced Catholicism, according to travellers,
still retain their heathen customs, and practise the
grossest immoralities.
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 9 -->

Coopang, the Dutch settlement, stands on the
south-west end of the island. There, Dutch
missionaries once exerted themselves with vigour, and
apparent success. During the eighteenth century no
labourers were sent out, and many baptized
Christians abandoned even the name of Christ, and
reverted to their favourite demon worship. In the year
1821 the first messenger, under the new era of
Christian missions, resumed the long-suspended duties ofa
Gospel minister in the place. This missionary, by
name Le Brun, was an excellent character, but was
spared only long enough to prepare himself for
usefulness in his new sphere : others succeeded him,
and carried on the duties of the station with visible
success. It is a common complaint, in the
correspondence of the missionaries, that multitudes who have
been received into the Christian church —probably
descendants of the early converts—have never
renounced their idolatrous habits. The unchristianized
natives they describe as slothful, apathetic, untrained
to reflection, living and dying like the brutes around
them. They have no established forms of religion,
but dread the power and deprecate the fury of infernal
spirits. This refers only to the tribes in the vicinity
of the settlement, where the Malayan language
forms an admixture with their native tongues. As
has been mentioned, those in the interior speak a
number of languages, very distinct from the Malay,
and live in the wildest state. I am not able to learn  
  
  
  b 5
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 10 -->
that any attempts have ever been made for their
conversion *.


A number of smaller islands in the
surroundingseas are occupied by the missionaries of the
Netherlands Society; among these isRotti, situated a short
distance south of Timor. In 1820 there were three
churches completed, and others in progress, on this
limited spot. Three hundred and sixty children were
enjoying regular instruction, all of them the
descendants of nominal Christians. The aboriginal
inhabitants are more energetic in mind and body than the
Malays, and the island yields a rich supply of rice
and palm sugar -j*.


East and north-east of Timor, one or two degrees
distant from it and from each other, are the small
islands of Letty, Moa, Kisser, and Roma. Each of
them is a mission station, occupied by one or more
missionaries. Some of them abound with inhabitants,
who have a language of their own, and whose customs
are entirely repugnantto the principles of Christianity,
which many profess. The instructions of themis
* At the close of 1831, the Dutch reports give an aggregate of
several thousands of Christians upon the island. Whether they
include those whose heathen customs the missionaries deplore, we
know not. In 1832, six missionaries arrived in the East; four of
whom went to an institution upon Timor, designed for fitting
European and native Christians for their work. One of them was
appointed to the chaplaincy ofthe Company: the others, it is hoped,
will penetrate beyond the maritime pails which have already been
explored.

f Of the recent reinforcements to these islands, one or two
missionaries have instructions to occupy Rotti.
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 11 -->
sionaries are generally conveyed through the Malayan
language, which, it is said, they are striving to make
the universal medium of intercourse. If it can be
accomplished without sacrificing the eternal interests
of the present generation, the object is worthy of their
strenuous efforts: it is calculated to cherish a spirit
of mutual benevolence among the natives, and it will
yield the greatest facility of labour to all succeeding
missionaries. One or two of them have acquired the
native speech; but, thus far, no translations have
been made—at least no books published. A
missionary, who visited the island of Letty in 1825,
reports that he found the schoolmaster efficiently
engaged in his duties, and that he baptized many,
especially in one district. A successor, who arrived
at the island in 1829, states that numbers of baptized
Christians were both ignorant and addicted to all the
vices of Paganism, That the same system, of
gathering multitudes indiscriminately into the visible
church, should be practised by some of the modern
missionaries, is a source of lamentation to their more
judicious brethren, and to all who take an interest in
their labours. The result is, as might be expected,
some " weary themselves for very vanity," and others
are obliged to " labour in the very fire," most
inconsiderately kindled against them.


At Wetter, which has been mentioned as included
within our prospect, the heathen are represented as
favourable to Christianity. The missionary who visited
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 12 -->
them in 1825, baptized numbers, and united many
in Christian marriage. This island had formerly been
under the care of the chaplains, but for the last forty
years Christian instruction had been almost entirely
suspended. The consequences need not be detailed,
when it is considered that little more than the name
and rites of Christianity constituted the sum oftheir
early knowledge.


After leaving the Ombay Passage, our course lay
through the Banda Sea, which takes its name from a
small group of islands situated two and a half
degrees east of our track. Here the Dutch have a
missionary, who, under date of 1824, reports that he
had been visiting those who professed Christianity,
from house to house. He was shocked at their
ignorance and heathenism: barring the difference of
name, they could not be distinguished from the
Mahommedans and heathen around them. The drums
of the soothsayers made a deeper impression upon
them, than all the truths of the Gospel.


Such was the depravity of the great mass of adults,
and such the example by which their children were
seduced into all kinds of wickedness, that the
missionary was constrained, under the deep emotions of
his soul, to exclaim, "Rivers of waters run down
mine eyes, because they keep not thy law." Still, a
few facts of some promise were noticed : there were
those who could, and did, read the Bible; the
schools, though languishing, were not closed; and a
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 13 -->
sew of the converts maintained a character worthy of
the religion they professed.


In former days there were congregations upon a
number of these islands, but the blight of death has
passed over them.


At Great Banda there are twenty-four plantations,
managed by as many native planters who bear the
name of Christ.


Still farther to the east, in nearly a south-east
direction from Banda, is a chain of islets, called by
the Dutch **'the Keys," which extend to the Arroo
group of the charts. The former are described as
fertile spots, producing a variety of fruits, and
peopled by a race of men who have ever shewn a peculiar
mildness of disposition and hospitality towards
Europeans. Whether this benevolence is a genuine
expression of the soul, or assumed from motives of
policy, has not been ascertained. The only ground
of suspicion is their physical weakness, and
destitution or paucity of arms.


The Arroo islands are extremely valuable, ancl
are said to contain a population of about twenty
thousand; they abound in all the delicious fruits of
the Moluccas, and swarm with poultry, and birds of
the richest, rarest plumage. They contain a small
band of professing Christians, a great many
Mahommedans, and a still greater number of heathen. From
the reports of the missionaries in their vicinity, these
islands hold out the most inspiriting invitation to the
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 14 -->
servants of Christ: the field is large, and numbers
would find delightful employment iu its culture. One
relative advantage, of the highest importance, is the
proximity of these islands to New Guinea, with whose
shores there is, no doubt, a constant intercourse,
and whose degraded millions might be approached
through this point of access.


Contrary winds and a temporary calm detained us
for two or three days in the Banda Sea.


On the 28th of January the large island of Booro
was descried, and the next morning we found
ourselves passing at the distance of a few miles from its
south-eastern shore. Besides its other valuable
productions, this island is the genial soil of the cajeput
tree, whose well-known oil is a principal article of
export. It is virtually under the dominion of the
Dutch, though, with the exception of a foreign
Resident, the inhabitants are governed by their own
Rajahs. The king of the country, and nine subordinate
chiefs, by whom he is assisted in judicial matters, are
Mahommedans. The inhabitants, whom the Dutch
call Alfories, have not submitted to the yoke of
Islamism, and, it is said, are not allowed to embrace
Christianity. Still the place is not entirely destitute
of Christian instruction. A missionary is stationed
here, who, under date of 1825, writes that the island is
divided into ten districts, and that there were about
ninety Christians, and one hundred and forty,
including children, who had been baptized.
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 15 -->

The state of religion among these few, differs in
DO '
no respects from the corruption prevailing in the other
islands. The judgments of God, in those
sweepingscourges, cholera and famine, it is reported, produced
considerable effect upon their fears, and brought them
for a time to a better state of mind.


The aborigines are characterized by gentleness
and timidity. Idleness, opium, smoking, and
drunkenness, are their reigning vices; dancing, their popular
amusement.


After leaving the Banda Sea, we passed through
the Straits of Manippa, which brought within our
horizon a number of important islands. Amboyna,
the principal one, is distinguished, among all the spice
settlements under European controul, for the extent and
beauty of its capital, the strength of its fortifications,
and the proportionately large number of its professing
Christians. It contains a population of between forty
and fifty thousand. Mr. Kam, the first missionary of
the new era, who arrived in 1815, reports that he
found twenty thousand native Christians, prepared, by
his predecessors, for attending the ordinances of the
Gospel. The nature of this preparation is not stated,
though the missionary probably includes all who had
been received into the visible church by its initiatory
rite, with their descendants. He found many districts,
whose inhabitants were formerly Christian, relapsed
into Paganism. A terrifying earthquake frightened
some of them back into the profession which they
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 16 -->
had abandoned. Mr. Kam commenced his labours,
here and in the neighbouring islands, with much
zeal and energy. Prompted by a spirit which every
missionary should possess, he looked upon himself as
a " debtor to all;" and consequently entered into every
sphere where he thought his services might be useful.
Much of his time was devoted to a visitation of those
islands where churches had been planted,'or where
there was an opening for the' introduction of the
Gospel. His journals shew an entire devotedness to his
Saviour's cause; though, from the many thousands
he baptized in his extensive and repeated circuits, we
cannot but fear that his views on this subject were
not the most judicious.


Two institutions were established at Amboyna for
the preparation of schoolmasters : one under a
committee of government officers, including the
missionary, who is the appointed chaplain; the other
under the sole direction of Mr. Kam, and designed
to prepare young men for less prominent, though
equally destitute, stations. These institutions, and
especially the latter, have been successful in their
operations. Other means have been employed for
the conversion of the heathen, with much visible
effect.


At Manippa, through the Straits of which we
sailed, there are many Mussulmans, and a few
Christians. The missionaries report that two villages had
cast away their idols, and embraced Christianity.
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 17 -->

We had the large and beautiful island of Ceram
in sight for a long time. Its lively verdure, its
towering mountains, its irregular and variegated surface,
and especially the history associated with it, tended to
render it an object of most interesting contemplation.
Travellers speak of some of its scenery as enchanting.
The missionaries describe it as exceedingly fertile. The
sago finds no soil so congenial to its perfection, as the
well-saturated bogs of Ceram. This valuable tree
grows wild, not merely in scattered clumps, but in
deep forests; supplying its indolent tribes with
abundant provision, and considerable wealth. The waters
teem with a variety of the finest fish. So that it has
been said of the natives of this island, as of the birds
of the air, " They neither sow, nor reap, nor gather
into barns." The inhabitants of the sea-coast are
principally Malays; in the inland districts, the
Alfories, or aborigines, abound. The shocking Diak
custom, of destroying human life by arts the most
treacherous and dishonourable, without provocation,
and merely to add human heads to the trophies of
their cruelty, is common to this island, to Borneo,
and to Celebes. Demon worship is the prevailing
superstition; and the infernal rites and horrid
imprecations employed in binding themselves to a
voluntary and perpetual slavery to the " rulers of
darkness," breathe the very spirit of hell.


When Mr. Kam visited this island, after his arrival
in these seas, he found that there had been no stated
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 18 -->
preacher for the last twenty years. He passed through
twelve districts, preaching, and administering the
sacraments pf the Gospel. After his return he received
intelligence that two villages had demolished their
temples. But, alas ! numbers of these stony-ground
hearers soon began to decline : so that the missionary
felt himself obliged to make them another visit. In
some districts religious exhortations had no effect.
Many of the Christians did not even believe in a
future state of existence.


At Kaibobo, in Ceram, a missionary is stationed.
He gives no favourable account of the progress of the
children in the schools, nor of the good example and
discipline of their parents at home. In a report of
Mr. Kam for 1827, he speaks of more than six
thousand church members, and upwards of two
thousand children under instruction*.


With the exception of Ternati, one of the
Moluccas, situated not far from the north coast of Gilolo,
we have gone over the principal stations under the
Netherlands Missionary Society in this part of the
Archipelago.


Ternati, though small, has long maintained an
importance above its neighbours. Its sultan has
acquired the sovereignty of many ofthe adjacent islands,
having extended his dominions to part of Celebes, and


* The discrepancy in these two statements may be easily
reconciled; though we fear that the ldast gratifying account is the most
correct.
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 19 -->
even to New Guinea. The missionary here has been
taken into the service of the government; and though
a man of excellent character, is said to be too sickly
to fulfil his duties among Christians, and, of course,
unable to attempt much for the heathen. The
situation is, probably, one of the most important for a
missionary colony in these seas.


Before we turn our backs upon the numerous
stations occupied by the Netherlands Society, and open
to their future exertions, a few facts merit our
attention. The extent of many of these islands, the
number oftheir inhabitants, their proximity to others still
more extensive and populous, render them highly
important for missionary establishments; while the
liberty enjoyed by Europeans, of visiting the coast and
traversing the interior of most of them, added to the
readiness with which the natives generally listen to
their instructions, and conform, by thousands, to the
external rites of Christianity, enhance their interest,
and give them a bold prominence among the most
inviting and promising spheres of Christian exertion.


To those acquainted with the history of these
missions, it may be thought strange that we do not
dwell more in detail upon the numbers who have, at
different times, renounced idolatry, and professed the
religion of Christ. Our only reason is, because the
qualifications for baptism, required by many of the
missionaries, differ so essentially from the views
entertained by the majority of those who will probably
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 20 -->
read this work, that numbers would convey no
correct idea of the success of their labours. In islands,
and districts of islands, occasionally visited by the
missionaries, we read of their preaching a few times,
performing the ceremony of marriage, baptizing
crowds of adults as well as children, and
administering the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. If these
places were all supplied with native teachers in whose
piety and judgment entire confidence could be placed,
our wonder at this hasty mode of procedure would
cease : but when we learn, from their own accounts,
that apostasy is very common, and that villages
and whole districts frequently fall back into their
former abominations, we must conclude, either that
the native teachers are unqualified for their duties, or
disproportioned in numbers to their stations; or, that
those admitted to the ordinances of the church are
received on other grounds than that repentance and
faith which the Scriptures enjoin.


It is not intended to assert that this course of
proceeding is approved of by all the present
missionaries; neither is it certain that it is pursued by
the majority. A very few labourers of incorrect
sentiments respecting the proper subjects of the
sacraments, are quite sufficient to produce all the
consequences we here deplore.


One fact, which strikes us powerfully, and which
may tend to explain, in a measure, what we cannot
approve of, is the paucity of labourers. Compared
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 21 -->
with most other societies, the one whose field and
operations we have been considering has done
nobly; but their hands are too feeble for the
immense work to be performed. Hundreds should be
sent forth; and hundreds would, no doubt, find
employment of the most delightful kind.


After leaving the Straits of Manippa, our course
was nearly north-east, through Dampier Straits, into
the Pacific. A multitude of islands, of rather
inconsiderable note, rose and sunk in the horizon, as we
glided gently along, until we found ourselves once
more riding upon the long swells of an open sea.
New-Guinea, or the Great Papua country, and
Waygiou, or Waijoo, between which we passed, remained
in sight many hours. The mountains of the former
appeared stupendous, and the distant coast resembles
hills of different altitudes and dimensions rising
separately from the ocean. It is rather extraordinary,
that, though we have been for many days
surrounded by human habitations, some of which, with
their possessors, we could distinctly discern, we have
received no visitors, and perceived but one prow in
motion.


Waijoo contains one hundred thousand
inhabitants. It is said that they trade to a considerable
extent with the Chinese, and that the greater part of
them speak the Chinese language. From- the
accounts of travellers, though we have seen nothing of
a recent date, we can find no reason why an
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 22 -->
intercourse might not be opened with them, and a mission
established upon their island. Surely the number of
souls is large enough to claim this duty from
Christians; and its situation is peculiarly favourable, both
for communication with home, and with the
important islands in its vicinity.


But it is to New-Guinea that the eye turns with
the deepest concern. This insular continent is
about twelve hundred miles in length, and from
fifteen to three hundred and sixty in breadth.
Navigators speak with rapture of the beauty of its coasts,
and the astonishing variety of its rich productions.
Among the ornaments of its natural history is the
farfamed bird of paradise, of which ten or twelve species
make it their favourite residence. It is inhabited by
several millions of souls, who are sunk in deep
intellectual ignorance and spiritual death. Many
distinct tribes, exceedingly opposite to each other in
appearance and habits, spread themselves through
its coasts and interior. The great mass consist of
Negroes, of a Herculean frame and jet-black
countenance, with prominent eyes, distended mouths,
spreading noses, and curled hair projecting in an
enormous bunch from the head. Some of them are
cannibals of the worst character, others are mild,
and obliging to strangers, disposed to trade upon
terms the most advantageous to the other party,
neither knowing the value of their own articles, nor
the worthlessness of those they most admire. Though
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 23 -->
we have never read of a single missionary having
touched upon its shores, the wiser and more
adventurous children of this world hesitate not to visit it
whenever their object can be gained *.


Thus we perceive, from the catalogue of islands
enumerated—and the list might be easily swelled, if
we were to proceed a short distance to the east—
what a sphere of Christian benevolence lies, in almost
total neglect, in these seas. It is, no doubt, judged
by some advisable to defer missionary engagements
until commerce shall open an access to those
barbarous regions, and prepare the way for the Gospel;
but even if the character and conduct of traders had
this general tendency, how long shall we wait ? Had
there been any strong inducements to commercial


* The following facts were extracted from the journal of a
captain, published in the Singapore Chronicle, under date of
1830 : they may be useful to some. At Dory of the charts, he
found a good harbour, and the people very friendly. They gave
him missoy bark, tripang, and tortoise-shell, in exchange for iron,
blue cloth, &c. At Myfori(Long Island ofthe charts) the Rajah
spoke Malay, but was absent; he afterwards met him, and found
him friendly. At Misori, or Schoten island, the people are
considered treacherous. At Paddydoo, or Traitor's Island, they are,
on the contrary, exceedingly friendly; and, as an expression of it,
carried their boat, when she grounded, about two miles. At
Koreering, or Jobie, a considerable island in the deep bay, the
natives were also very friendly. At Ansoose, off Jobie, latitude
two degrees south, there are a number of islands; the natives are
not to be trusted. At Coordoo (Geebrinks, East Point, of the
charts), a small village on the east point of the great bay, their
boats were seized, with six men in them : some of the men were
killed in a savage manner. The bottom and east of the great bay
is said to be inhabited by tlie worst description of cannibals. The
principal trade is with the Chinese.
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 24 -->
enterprize, the advantages would not have been
neo-lected until now. And as it has been found that
the influence of men from Christian countries in
pursuit of wealth, is generally prejudicial to the
extension of the religion whose principles they fail to
exemplify, it is, no doubt, favourable that such a
preliminary barrier has not been reared against the
introduction ofthe truth.


The servants of Christ engaged in foreign
commerce might afford the most valuable aid, in
hastening the conversion of these nations. Indeed, without
their assistance we scarcely know how any thing
can be done for the present. They might dispatch
a ship on an exploring tour, to obtain more
information about the character and circumstances of the
different tribes of natives, and to determine the
most eligible sites for missions. The ship could
probably defray her expenses, by the same traffic which
others carry on who have no such object in view.
When the best localities are ascertained, and
missionaries sent forth to occupy them, nothing further
would be required for facilitating their work, but to
furnish them with small vessels, capable of
navigating these seas, and to favour them with an
annual visitor or two from home, to supply them with
necessities and comforts.


With the blessing of God's Spirit upon their
labours, which we believe would be quickly and amply
bestowed, the missionaries would soon place
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 25 -->
themselves upon a permanent and advantageous footing,
and probably repay their commercial friends
abundantly for their assistance. Thus the Gospel, by the
light it sheds, and the diligence it commands, would
prepare the way for trade, and the benefits that
would accrue to different and widely distant nations
would be incalculable. Millions, now below the
brutes, would be exalted to the enjoyment of all the
blessings of this life, and to the hopes of the glories
of the life to come.


But lest the plan here proposed should be rejected,
or, what amounts to the same thing, not acted upon,
another may be suggested, in which the pecuniary
sacrifice or hazard would be less. Those ships bound
to Canton, which are obliged, like ourselves, to make
this Eastern passage, might attempt the pre-requisite
task of exploring; and upon its completion, if the
trade did not answer their expectations, might
proceed to Canton, without incurring much risk, or losing
much time. And thus one or two out-of-season ships
could annually touch at any station selected, and, by
administering to the health and comfort of the
missionaries, afford material service to the cause in which
they are engaged.


But whence the necessity of holding out a
temporal reward, as an inducement to Christians to
discharge their duties What, but the glory of the
Redeemer, can be the object of commerce in the
purposes of God? and what could more loudlyproc
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 26 -->
claim this object, than the sanctification of many to
Himself, to whom He has entrusted the talent of
such extensive usefulness ? " Surely the isles shall
wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring
thy sons from far*."


If ships are to be employed in the benevolent
plans of the Saviour, who, that understands his own
honour, as well as duty, would hesitate to favour
these purposes, and thus to identify himself, and his
possessions, with the instrumentality employed in
the regeneration ofa world ?


After leaving the Straits of Dampier, the wind
obliged us to stand off in nearly an easterly direction.
On the 8th of February we made the Pelew Islands,
and were soon espied by the natives, who came off in
pursuit of us. One canoe, with six men and women
in it perfectly naked, succeeded in gaining the ship •
but, although a rope was thrown to them, which they
caught, and our progress was checked, their boat
was drawn under the stern of the ship, and they
were obliged to let go their hold, to save themselves.
In their first attempt to gain the lee of the ship
they were disappointed, and as they were defeated in
their purpose a second time, even after attaining
that position, they were evidently disinclined to
renew the effort. After we separated, they remained
a long time stationary, as though indulging in the  
  
  
  * Isaiah lx. 9.
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 27 -->
listlessness of disappointment, or endeavouring to
re-excite their hopes for another trial. Their proa
was apparently the excavated trunk of a tree. Its
breadth bore no proportion to its length. The sail
was triangular. To the windward side was attached
an out-rigger, projecting about three feet. On this
as many sat as were necessary to preserve the balance
of the boat, while one was constantly employed in
discharging the water, received from every wave.


The performance of these canoes, and the skill
and dexterity with which they are managed, are
surprising. They come dancing over the waves like
\"fairy sprites," and with a velocity which it demands
a stiff breeze and rough sea for a ship to equal.
One or two of them continued in pursuit of us, until
their small islands were left below our horizon, and
themselves shut in by the shades of the evening.


The natives of these islands were formerly
represented as the mildest and most benevolent specimens
of unenlightened men. This character they have
lately lost by attempts at violence, which prove that
their previous kindness was neither natural, nor the
result of principle. It is said that when they learned
the uses of iron, they made a desperate effort to cut off
a ship and murder all hands, in order to secure the
object oftheir cupidity. Whether they may not have
had another motive for the attack, such as revenge for
offensive conduct, we cannot ascertain. But whatever
may be their present character, they are to beChriso 2
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 28 -->
tianized, and a mission might be planted, and
sustained through the assistance of the ships passing
in this track. Let barbarous nations be informed
that they are to be often visited by vessels belonging
to the friends of those who labour among them, and
it would not fail to influence them in their conduct
towards the missionaries.

  CHAPTER II.  
  
  
  CHINA.

February 17th, 1830.—Latitude, 22 degrees North;
longitude, 115 degrees 18 minutes East.


Early this morning we were called up to view the
Chinese fishing boats, scattered in almost every
direction around us. They had ventured beyond the
sight of land, and were fishing in pairs, with a net
trailing between them. These small boats are human
habitations, occupied by as many generations as are
usually permitted to exist contemporaneously. What
a prison for intellectual beings, with little prospect
of a change in this life, and no knowledge of
immortality in the next!


It is said they are not allowed to trade with foreign
vessels; and their exceeding shyness, and the
attendance of the Government boats, confirm the existence
of such an interdict. Two hundred were counted at
one time.


18th.—To-day we caught the first glimpse of China,
while sailing in a line with its coast. The distance
was too great for us to distinguish any thing but the
shadowy outline of its hills.  
  
  
  We have passed the latitude of Formosa, which
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 30 -->
claims a notice, alike on account of its own inherent
interest, and the sad tale of missions which its
history unfolds. A chain of mountains, extending
nearly north and south, forms a natural boundary
between its aboriginal inhabitants and the Chinese.
The western coast, in the possession of the latter, is
said by the old Dutch writers to merit the name by
which it is known. The eastern division is inhabited
by several tribes, among which is a negro race of
immense size. In the early part of the seventeenth
century the Dutch introduced Christianity into this
island. A number of chaplains successively engaged
in the undertaking, who baptized multitudes, and
formed many congregations. Parts of the
Scriptures were translated into the vernacular tongue of
the aborigines, which differs greatly from the language
ofthe empire. These were sent to Amsterdam, with
other Christian books, for publication; but there is
no evidence that they ever went through the press.
According to the account of the missionaries, this
extensive field soon promised the most abundant fruits.
But their prospects and projects were quickly
defeated : the island was captured by a pirate, who
massacred some of the chaplains, destroyed
Christianity, and re-established idolatry. This event
occurred in 1661, since which period the Chinese have
spread themselves in numbers over its western section.
At present it is in a state of constant rebellion, the
resort of the disaffected towards the Government.  
  
  
  19th.—The dawn of this morning disclosed the
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 31 -->
bluff, barren peaks of the Ladrone and
neighbouringislands, called by the Chinese " the old ten thousand
hills." Our approach was soon descried by the
vigilant natives, and before sunrise, a tall, muscular,
swarthy man came on board, and offered himself as
a pilot: when informed that his services were not
required, and convinced, from the ill success of his
repeated applications, that money could not be
earned, he assumed the less honourable office of a
beggar. The same means were adopted by others who
succeeded him in the course of the day, and tried all
possible expedients to obtain money or money's worth.


From our visitors we received information of a
variety of recent events, chiefly relating to foreign
residents in Canton, some of which were fraught with
painful interest. Many of them employed a broken
English, of rather ludicrous peculiarity—an unknown
tongue, indeed, to the uninitiated, but sufficient to
communicate ideas, on ordinary topics, to those who
had been educated in the same school. With one,
whom the captain recognised, an agreement was
soon made, and dispatches forwarded to Canton.
The time to which he was limited, and on which his
recompence depended, was scarcely sufficient to allow
of the least interval of rest, although his countenance
and conduct evinced that he considered ten dollars,
the stipulated sum, an ample compensation. The
distance of the place at which he met us from Canton is
about eighty miles, and the risk of being detected by
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 32 -->
the Government officers, in a business interdicted by
law, by no means inconsiderable. Between eight and
nine in the evening we reached the anchorage at
Lintin. This entrance ofthe " celestial regions," is far
from interesting. The numerous islands are rough and
desolate, and, with the exception ofa few spots near
the sea, there is scarcely the trace of a man or beast,
or the appearance of vegetation, to be discovered.


20th.—Our present anchorage is the depot of
smugglers, where the opium ships are moored, and whence
this deathful drug, to the amount of several millions of
dollars annually, is conveyed throughout the empire.
Among the boats clandestinely engaged in the local
traffic, are a number commissioned for the protection
of lawful commerce, but which are as actively
employed against the interests of the Government as
they would be in the maintenance of its laws, if
the revenue officers, who have them in charge, could
fulfil the duties of their appointment as easily, and
with greater advantage to themselves.


This afternoon, for the first time after a hundred
and twenty-seven days, our feet touched solid ground,
and though on a heathen shore, far from our native
land, we felt a gratification peculiar to the
wavetossed prisoner when released from his tedious
confinement. It was the island of Lintin, the resort
and habitation of fishermen, and the possession of a
few families, who cultivate the ground and supply
the shipping with provisions. Almost every foot of
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 33 -->
land which had been levelled by nature, or could be
reduced by art, was in cultivation; while the
adjacent springs and ponds of water were all turned to
account.


We attempted to enter a small village, but an old
man came out, and with a courteous air of authority
forbade us. In some of the huts near the beach they
were engaged at their meals, and, with mouths as full
as could be crammed without preventing mastication,
invited us to stop and take " a little chou-chou " with
them. They impart a flavour to their rice, by adding
a small portion of meat, fish, or vegetables. These
seasonings are generally placed in appropriate vessels, on
the table, if they have one, or on the ground, in the
midst of the circle. Each person is supplied with a
bowl of rice, to which he conveys the more piquant
provisions by means of two small sticks, held between
the thumb and fingers of the right hand, and, placing
the bowl in contact with the lower jaw, he shovels
into his mouth as much of the rice as his distended
cheeks can well contain.


The fact in which we are most interested, and
which we cannot consider without reflecting upon
the ignorance and apathy of the Christian world, is
the unrestricted intercourse we have with multitudes,
who welcome us to their huts on shore, and come
around us in the ship, with all the ingenuousness and
docility of children. If we knew their language,
there is not the least reason why we might notconc 5
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 34 -->
verse with them as freely on religious subjects as on
all others.


26th.—As the ship was to remain at Lintin for
several days, we engaged a native boat to carry us
to Macao, about eighteen miles distant, and started
after breakfast on Monday the 22d. The intervening
islands and distant hills present the same sterile,
volcanic aspect; and scarcely an object of the least
interest is seen, until the bay and town of Macao
open to the view in delightful contrast. These
are entirely concealed by a projecting point of land,
until close at hand. After fruitless conjectures where
a European town of the least size can be situated,
amid the scenes of desolation and ruggedness whicii
appear from the level of the water, the change is
sudden and unexpected. A long line of white
European buildings, winding with a gentle sweep around
the crescent shore of the bay; large military and
ecclesiastical establishments crowning the summits
of the hills; with a motley group of chapels, and
houses of almost every size and construction, burst
upon the view at once, and hold the mind, for a
moment, in delightful surprise.


Macao stands upon an island, or rather a peninsula
projecting from an island, with a beautiful bay in
front, and a sheet of water in the rear. The irregular
surface of the town, changing its appearance with
every new position, encompassed with hill and dale,
scattered villages and cultivated fields, islets and
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 35 -->
bays, with an extensive and diversified water scenery,
all beheld from the adjacent hills, may well command
the admiration of visitors.


Variety is the most remarkable feature in the
buildings. The houses occupied by foreign
merchants are generally spacious, and well adapted tothe
climate. The public edifices, and the numerous
churches, though some of them are large, display
nothing peculiar in their exterior appearance or their
furniture. Much of the town is in possession of
the Chinese, and consists, according to their taste,
of low, confined huts, and narrow, filthy streets.
According to a recent estimate, the number of
inhabitants is about fifty thousand, of whom forty-five
thousand are said to be Chinese; others suppose the
whole amount not to exceed thirty or thirty-five
thousand. Macao is the residence of those ladies
who have accompanied their husbands to China, and
the summer retreat of the majority of foreigners
engaged in commerce at Canton. The number of
English families, including one American, does not
exceed a dozen.


One of the principal objects of curiosity to the
traveller, is the grotto of Camoens, where the poet
composed his celebrated Luciad. It is enclosed
within the pleasure grounds ofa private residence, and
combines the advantages of fine scenery, refreshing
air, and undisturbed retirement. It is formed of
three large rocks, two of which are upright and
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 36 -->
support the third. The place where he is reported to
have sat, is a small cavity in one ofthe rocks, which
at present is occupied by a representative of less
perishable material than himself. With a stern
contour, a martial air, and the want of an eye, lost in
the Saracen wars, there is very little to remind one
of the poet whose charming verse, according to his
countrymen, could scarcely be surpassed.


The history of Macao is involved in considerable
uncertainty, but those points of inquiry most
interesting to the Christian community are by no means
obscure.


The Portuguese say that they received it from the
emperor about the middle of the sixteenth century,
as an expression of gratitude for expelling a band of
pirates, who, making it their head-quarters, infested
the coast and blocked up the port of Canton. The
Chinese assert that the place was gradually usurped
by tlie Portuguese, in their rage for foreign
possessions; and recent researches shew, that, if the
former are correct, they cannot produce the emperor's
grant to prove it. In whatever way possession was
gained, the Jesuits and others immediately took the
colony under their spiritual charge, erected churches,
founded a monastery and college, and opened a
communication with different parts of the interior.
If the purity of their faith had harmonized with the
force of their misguided zeal, there is every reason
to believe that this Pagan empire would have assumed
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 37 -->
a different aspect long before now. The truth would
perhaps have awakened persecution earlier, but it
would neither have provoked it by anti-Christian
measures, nor suffered so severely from its deadliest
rage.


It is difficult to determine to what extent the
forces of Catholicism have been weakened in China.
Since the general expulsion of the European priests,
numbers have ventured, and are continually
venturing, into the interior, although thev have
generally been conveyed to their charge in a clandestine
manner. Some have been sent from Macao to Pekin,
to supply the board of mathematicians: but the
emperor's request, and their avowed object in
complying with it, were alike distinct from all ecclesiastical
interference. Very recently, one of them was
transferred from Pekin to Canton, with considerable pomp,
and for the purpose of returning to Europe. It was
said by many to be a plan of the emperor's to get
him respectably out of the country; others maintain
that he requested permission to visit his aged mother
before her death. However this may be, I am
informed that at present there is but one Roman Catholic
priest employed in the emperor's service, and for the
last twenty years no fresh ones have been invited *.


* The following estimate of the Roman Catholic forces was
obtained from one oftheir most credible priests, by a mutual friend.—

The French mission has two bishops, four or five European
missionaries, thirty native missionaries, and fifty-one thousand
converts.
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 38 -->

In the college of St. Joseph, formerly in the hands
of the Jesuits, there are a number of Chinese youth,
educated at the expense of the Portuguese
Government exclusively for the priesthood. These are
ordained as missionaries to the interior. Other
natives are received, and instructed at their own charges.
Besides this institution, there are about twelve
churches and forty priests for the limited population
professing the Roman Catholic faith.


Our attention was frequently arrested by crowds of
women visiting the different temples, and we were
constrained to believe the season to be one of peculiar
sanctity, or the place greatly given to superstition.
Whether the first conjecture was correct or not, the
facts that quickly came to our knowledge left no
grounds to doubt the second. The patron saint, or
rather tutelary deity, ofthe place,isSt.Antonio. Having
been skilled in the use of" carnal weapons" in the early
part of his career, he is exceedingly popular among
the military, and is represented as a valuable assistant
in war. When the Dutch attacked the place, it is
said by many that he appeared in the air, and routed
the invaders; others ascribe the victory to the timely


The Portuguese mission has one bishop, one European
missionary, twenty-nine native missionaries, and eighty thousand
converts. At Macao they have two seminaries, eight European
missionaries, and one thousand converts.

The Italian mission has four European missionaries, and thirty
thousand converts.

The Spanish mission has one bishop, two European missionaries,
and thirty-five thousand converts.
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 39 -->
aid of John the Baptist, the battle having occurred
upon his day. The Portuguese Government allow
St. Antonio the pay of a captain, and honour him
with, or require from him in return, an annual feast
of thirteen days' continuance. According to my
informant, who is one of their number, and has
frequently participated in the festivities of the season,
they suppose it by no means inconsistent with the
pleasure of the saint to indulge in excesses which
set at defiance all the laws of temperance, and bring
their religion into discredit among their heathen
neighbours. It is difficult to conceive how grosser
idolatry could exist, than that which prompts some
of the acts of their devotion to this deified hero.
They are not satisfied with " bowing down before the
graven image," but, not admitting the very heathen's
distinction—I should say, his professed distinction—
between the deity and his representation, they carry
the figure in procession, with military pomp, to make
an annual visit to the image-of St. Francis, presiding
at another church.


To the mind of one who feels an interest in the
conversion of the world, it is a painful circumstance
that the only spot under European controul, in the
whole empire of China, should exhibit to the heathen
the most gross and absurd notions of that holy
religion whose name they attach to their worse than
Pagan abominations. Macao, and Manilla, on the
island of Luzon, which are among the most
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 40 -->
advantageous foreign posts for Chinese missions, are subject
to a power, and exert an influence, which have the
double tendency of keeping the true light from
entering, and of prejudicing the minds of the heathen
against it, should it penetrate. The same anti-christian
influence prevails in the Chinese island of Hainan,
where the Roman Catholic religion is said to be still
prevalent; and in many of the adjacent kingdoms on
the west and south, where the language is best
known, and the intercourse with China most frequent.


Japan, on the east, has been arrayed as powerfully
against the religion of the Cross, as Satanic malice
could desire. So that, by means of this spurious faith,
the great enemy of God and man has attempted to
raise impregnable barriers against the introduction of
the Gospel into China. But how unable the policy and
forces of hell, though intimidating to the faithless
mind of man, to resist the power and wisdom which
shall soon be brought to bear against them! Every
difficulty of the kind should but simplify and
strengthen our faith in that word which is pledged
to destroy them all, and the striking and speedy
accomplishment of which, shall doubtless be a
subject of admiration and gratitude to all the followers
of Christ.


In the town and immediate vicinity of Macao are
several Chinese temples, to which a few priests ofthe
Budah sect are attached. The most remarkable
is situated on the south-west side of the town. It
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 41 -->
consists of a number of small buildings, on the
acclivity of a steep hill, grouped in a fanciful manner
with large upright rocks and overhanging trees.
The rough lines of nature and the polish of art are
blended in striking Contrast in this grotesque form
of Pagan superstition.


The principal part of the time unoccupied in our
excursions, was agreeably passed in the family of Dr.
Morrison, who had left the place but a few days
before our arrival. We were happy to learn that the
Doctor had had the recent gratification of baptizing
another native convert. The English Factory, during
their semi-annual residence here, are allowed to
have service performed by their chaplain; and Dr.
Morrison is not prevented from holding a religious
meeting, every Sabbath, in his own dwelling.


On the morning of the 24th we left this pleasant
retreat, and, wafted by a fresh breeze, reached the
ship about noon. As each had expected that some
of the rest would cater for our breakfast, vve were
obliged to satisfy a craving appetite upon the boiled
rice and salted cabbage of our temperate boatmen.
On our arrival, we found that a small European
vessel had been sent for us from Canton, but, owing
to the uncertainty of our return, had sailed. The
event left us the choice of remaining a number of
days in the ship, in this cold and rainy season, or of
venturing in a native " fast boat," contrary to one of
their barbarous prohibitions. We soon decided on
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 42 -->
the latter alternative, and left the ship in the twilight
of evening. We were obliged to spend the night in
an apartment fitted up for the lodgings of the
boatmen and the residence of their gods. A group of
small gilded images, seated in a shrine decorated
with coloured paper, occupied one corner, and
received the homage of the crew. Before the shrine
an incense stick of sandal-wood was kept lighted,
and a lamp burning. The cabin, in which the idols,
part of the crew, ourselves and baggage, were stowed,
was so low that vve could barely sit upright. After
changing our position as often as an opposing wind
changed the course of our boat, we found ourselves
at day-break but a very short distance above the last
fort. This was a point of safety which the men had
toiled hard and silently to gain, before the light
should expose us to those on shore. During the
morning, though they scrutinized with a good glass
every object of suspicion, they appeared to place so
much dependence upon the performance of their
brigantine, and their own muscular assistance, as to
dismiss all apprehension, and to labour with much
cheerfulness. Indeed, as far as we are capable of
judging, liveliness is a prominent characteristic of
the Chinese.


Low lands appropriated to the culture of rice, and
ranges of hills with no other verdure than a few
scattered trees, made up the scenery between our
position at day-break and Whampoa. A few temples
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 43 -->
appeared in different parts of the low lands, and one
of considerable elevation crowned the summit of a
high hill.


About the middle of the afternoon vve reached
Whampoa, the principal anchorage for vessels
engaged in lawful traffic with China. A recent
difficulty with the Government had detained the stately
ships employed in the service ofthe East India
Company; and the yearly fleet, consisting of twenty
vessels or upwards, with those of other nations
employed in the China trade, were moored within a
short distance of each other. The number of
seamen engaged in the Company's service, and attached
to the shipping in the harbour, is about three
thousand. What a congregation might be gathered,
from those who speak the English language, if the
walls of national and ecclesiastical separation were
entirely demolished, and if the custom of keeping
holy the Lord's-day were universally observed !


The distance between Whampoa and Canton is
about twelve miles. A strong opposing current kept
us four hours on the way, and made it nine in the
evening before we arrived. For some time after we
started, there was sufficient light to distinguish every
remarkable object on land and water. Among the
former are large pagodas, towering in the air, and
darkened and mouldering with age. Two of them are
situated on small eminences—" high places
"—'Compared with the surrounding country, and stand forth
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 44 -->
with commanding prominence. They are nine stories
in heigbt, of an octagonal form, with doors or niches
on each side of every story, and gradually diminishing
in circumference to the top. Their sides and summits
are partially covered with shrubs and herbage,
springing from beds of earth, which it must have required
ages to collect and consolidate *.


As might be expected, there is a great variety in
the structure and internal arrangements of the boats.
Those intended for sea are too primitive and clumsy
to be any thing but the product of the earliest and
dullest invention. The bow and stern rise to a
great elevation, and present such a dangerous
surface to the wind, as to account for the numerous
losses sustained every year. European
improvements are disallowed. Some of the small Government
barges display a degree of taste and skill in
construction which form a strong contrast to the mass around
them. The consequence and curse of spiritual
ignorance—alas! too common where that ignorance is
wilful—are apparent in many of the boats decorated
and furnished to decoy " the simple," and lead him
\"into paths inclining unto the dead."  
  
  
  We had scarcely gained half our distance, when


* These towers were erected by the descendants of Dchingis
Khan, in the Yuen dynasty, during the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. It was a prevalent superstition of the times that they
were effectual in repressing demoniacal and noxious influences
in the surrounding country, and that their efficacy was graduated
by their height.
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 45 -->
  
  " * * * * Sorrowing we beheld  
  
  
  The night come on; but soon did night display
More wonders than it veiled."


As the shades of evening darkened round us,
great numbers of lamps broke through the gloom,
and appeared either ranged in rows, almost as far as
the eye could reach, or changing their position and
varying the general aspect, according to the different
directions of the moving vessels. The scene was
more like magic than reality, and calculated to awaken
ideas, or call up visions, which seldom visit collected
minds in wakeful hours. As we approached the city
our progress became more interrupted by crowds
of boats, and such was their density when we arrived
within a short distance of the landing-place, that
the men were obliged to exchange their oars for
short paddles, and work their way through whatever
opening they could find or form.


On Thursday, February 25th, 1830, we reached
our ultimate destination, and were most kindly
received by C. W. Talbot, Esq., the consular agent,
whose father and brother had been our
fellow-passengers, and to whose hospitality we were commended by
our friends in America. We were soon visited by Dr.
Morrison, who, as might be expected, welcomed his
fellow-missionaries into this long-neglected field with
no ordinary joy. A career of more than
two-andtwenty years' labour, under the many embarrassments
and trials which were experienced, especially at first,
without the permanent assistance of a single
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 46 -->
companion—his health, too, being shattered by toil and
anxieties—have, as might be supposed, sufficiently
prepared him to welcome those whose avowed
object is the same, and who may be expected to find
their highest interest in its promotion. From many
of the residents, and especially from those of our
own countrymen to whom we had letters, we soon
enjoyed all those polite and kind attentions which
are calculated to reconcile a stranger to an abode in
foreign parts.
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 47 -->
  
  CHAPTER III.  
  
  
  CHINA — CANTON AND ITS VICINITY.

It may be acceptable to the reader to interrupt the
chronological order of events, and present at the
commencement a picture of Canton, and the places and
objects in its vicinity which are the most worthy of
notice.


The city stands upon the north bank of the
Chookeang, or Pearl river, nearly eighty miles from
the sea. Its site is almost a level: it is bounded in
the rear by a range of naked, uninteresting hills.
Including the river and neighbourhood, the
population has been estimated at fifteen hundred thousand.
The city itself is surrounded by walls, within which
the stranger is not allowed to enter : the suburbs, or
unwalled town, of about equal extent and
populousness, being alone accessible to foreigners. There is
nothing in the locality ofthe place, the arrangement of
its streets, or the style of its buildings, calculated to
call forth the admiration of the visitor. The scene,
it is true, affords abundant interest to the stranger;
but it is the interest of novelty alone, and soon
leaves the mind without an agreeable recollection.
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 48 -->
The houses are generally low, narrow, and exceedingly
compact. Some of the factories, or hongs, especially
those occupied by the tea-merchants, are immensely
spacious, and contain a vast number of
compartments; but they must be entered before you can
determine their locality, as there is nothing to
indicate them externally.


The width of the streets varies from about three to
fifteen feet, measuring from house to house; and the
average width would probably not exceed eight feet.
Even in passing through the business districts, I
have frequently extended my arms and reached the
opposite houses. The principal streets are occupied
by merchants and mechanics, and their shops are
so constructed as to open in front, and expose their
contents to the observation of the passenger. Boards,
with large painted or gilded characters, intended for
signs, are placed before each door, and, facing the
direction of the street, constitute its most ornamental
objects.


The trades are generally found in close vicinity.
The different classes of mechanics bind themselves
to certain conventional regulations, and each party
has a public hall of meeting, for consultation,
feasting, and dramatic amusements. Those articles which
are most saleable to foreigners are brought to the
streets adjacent to the factories. It is amusingfto
examine the heterogeneous contents of many of these
shops, and no less so to find that the spirit of the
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 49 -->
proprietor is still more accommodating than his
wellstored house. If your search does not discover the
required article, you have only to ask for it, and if
attainable any where, or by any means, upon your
terms, you have entered the right shop, and need
proceed no farther.


Economy of room, to the exclusion of comfort,
convenience, and cleanliness, appears to be the sole
object in the lanes where the women and children
are kenneled. This is the only specimen of
domestic life accessible to the foreigner, and it is said
that the families of persons of considerable wealth
are obliged to exist under these circumstances. It
requires a considerable degree of courage and
perseverance to thread the mazes of some of these alleys,
and emerge into air and space. Elbows and angles,
of almost every shape, formed by the blind corners of
buildings, oppose the progress of the adventurer, and,
if he dare proceed, perplex him by their multiplicity.
At the corners of the streets are wickets, which can
be readily closed, and are well calculated to separate
a rabble, or confine a thief. These are shut at night,
and guarded by watchmen.


Notwithstanding the limited space between the
houses, the thoroughfare of the streets is in many
places still more straitened by the stands of butchers
fishmongers, fruiterers, hucksters, mechanics, quacks,
and often by jugglers, story-tellers, and gamblers,
with their attendants. As the articles exposed for  
  
  
  D
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 50 -->
sale in the streets are chiefly adapted to the necessities
of the day, the extreme to which the principle of
accommodation is carried furnishes a criterion of the
pecuniary circumstances of the mass of the people.
Poultry and fish are divided into very minute
portions. A quarter of a fowl, the head and neck, and
frequently the entrails alone, is all they can afford.
This of course is a piece of luxury, and designed
merely to give a relish to their ordinary and less
extravagant fare. Vegetables, from their cheapness,
are so indispensable to the daily support of the
community, that they are exposed for sale in the
streets in the greatest profusion. But the display
of tea in the shops is the most amusing. The
Chinese, as is well known, drink universally the black
teas. These are sold, not simply according to their
qualities, but according to the strength which remains
after their virtues have been partially extracted by
less indigent purchasers.


Fruit abounds in Canton. Those kinds indigenous
to temperate regions are, indeed, of an inferior quality,
but the tropical varieties arrive at a high perfection;
and a few species there are designated by Chinese
names, and probably peculiar to that empire*.


Besides the vigilance and skill required in
navigating this channel, so narrowed and obstructed by


* Among the fruits are the following: Oranges, lemons,
shaddocks, pomegranates, grapes, pears, peaches, plums, ananas,
bananas, mangoes, papaw, lie-chel, long-yuen, or-lams, diospyrns,
loquat, long-hok, parsimmons, &c.
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 51 -->
the numerous articles referred to, it is necessary to
comfort and cleanliness to catch the warnings and
watch the motions of the porters, who carry all
moveable bodies upon their shoulders, and who constitute
no inconsiderable portion of the moving multitude.
Their burden is suspended to the ends or centre of
bamboos, according to its separability and weight,
and transferred, however bulky and ponderous, to
any distance, with much dispatch.


Such is the number of these labourers that their
voices are constantly ringing in our ears, and such is
the throng around them that their progress depends
almost as much on their lungs as their muscles.


One class, called by the Chinese " horses without
tails," address you in a more authoritative tone.
These are the bearers of men of distinction and
wealth, who generally appear abroad in sedan chairs,
and often take up so much of the small streets with
these vehicles, as to leave but a dangerous space
between them and the houses.


Among the objects most calculated to attract the
attention and arouse the sympathies of the Christian,
are the indices of their moral debasement. Their
temples are numerous, their gods without number.
One or more idols, are seated in state in every
temple; while others, probably of inferior dignity
and office, are standing near. Some of these are
frightful looking figures; all are gross in form,
answering to their notions of bodily elegance, or  
  
  
  d2
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 52 -->
rather of bodily comfort, which appears of higher
importance to a Chinaman. The structure of the
temple, as well as the number and arrangement of
the images, depends upon the tenets of the sect to
which they belong.


The three leading sects in China are known, in
the Mandarin dialect, by the names of Joo, Fuh,
Taou—i. e. the Confucians, Buddhists, and theTaou,
or Alchymic sect, " the mystics of the heathen world
in China."


The first and last originated in China; the second
was introduced from India, soon after the Christian
era, and, principally by means of the circulation of
tracts, has become the most prevalent superstition in
the empire. The Buddhists and Taou sects inculcate
future rewards and punishments; decking the former
in all the charms of sensuality and sloth, and
representing the latter by every horrid combination of
bodily torture.


Notwithstanding all the admiration heaped upon
Confucius and his system, by ignorance in the empire,
and infidelity in more enlightened parts, that
philosopher confessed that he "knew but little about the
gods, and therefore preferred saying nothing on the
subject." Respecting the immortality ofthe soul, and
a future state of retribution, he advances nothing.
The common opinion of his followers is, that virtue is
rewarded and vice punished in the individuals, or in
their posterity, onjy on earth. They speak of the
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 53 -->
immortal principle as being at death " annihilated,"
"melted," "scattered."


From one of the native books it appears that there
are in China upwards of one thousand five hundred
and sixty temples dedicated to Confucius. About
sixty-two thousand victims—bullocks, pigs, sheep,
deer—are annually sacrificed, and twenty-seven
thousand six hundred pieces of silk offered, to the manes
of the sage. This is the wisdom of the learned heathen,
who generally teach that " death is annihilation,"
and who sometimes affirm that there is neither " God,
angels, nor spirits." To whom, to what, do they
present these offerings ? Like many in Christian
lands, these very persons shew the insincerity of their
professions in the prospect of death. Then the
priests of Budh*, whom they despise and ridicule
in health, are called in to give the mind some
support under its dread, if not its consciousness, of
immortality.


Besides the numerous temples in the city, small
images, answering to their notions of district gods,
are placed in the corners of the streets, and receive
the homage of the neighbourhood. Not satisfied with
these, every house has its family altar, either before
the door or in the principal room, frequently in both
places. Those in front of the house are generally
small alcoves in a projecting platform, furnished with
a few idols, or, more commonly, with the Chinese  
  
  
  * The Confucians have no priests of their own.
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 54 -->
written character signifying God, or superior being.
On walking out in the evening, the fumes of
sandalwood, of which their incense-stick is made, assail
the senses in every direction, and their light almost
answers the purpose of city lamps in these narrow
streets. These, with a few wax tapers, and one or two
unmeaning bows of the person who prepares them, are
the daily offerings made to the images of China.


The popular religion of China, if definable at all,
is probably made up of a combination of tenets held
by the different sects in the empire, with a mixture
of notions and customs which neither system
originated, but which the votaries of each practise.
Among these customs are, sacrificing to the dead,
and burning gold and silver paper on religious
occasions. The former of these customs, if not both of
them, appears to their minds the most sacred of all
observances*.


The observance of the fifteenth day of the moon,
and of its full, is almost universal. Among a people
fond of sloth, and addicted to sensuality, it is not to be
wondered at that feast-days should be popular, and
their frequent recurrence welcome to those who have
the means of providing for them. Among the most


* The following exhortation is taken from one of their moral
works:


\"While (parents are) alive, on going out of doors inform them;
on returning, shew them your face.—When dead, also, on going
abroad mention it (before the tablet, which they set up in every
house at the decease of parents and relatives); when you return,
keep a feast before them; serve them when dead, just as when alive."
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 55 -->
prevalent of their doctrines is the Buddhistic notion
of transmigration, which hangs " in terrorem " over
the more sedate and thinking class of the nation.


According to the excellent Dr. Milne *, " When we
behold the best of the rulers of China, and the most
enlightened of her sages (i. e. Confucius),-worshipping
any god or no god at all, just as suited time, place,
and the taste of the age, what shall we think of their
hearts, virtues, and productions I Can we suppose
those systems capable of directing the bulk of the
people to God, which left their authors to worship
the heavens and the earth, mountains and rivers, the
gods of the kitchen and the spirits of the dead ? "


\"The current of Chinese idolatry widened and
deepened as it flowed, by the accession of tributary
streams from Western and Eastern Tartary. Most
of the forms of mythology which make any figure
in the page of history, now exist in China; except
that their indecent parts, and their direct tendency
to injure human life, have been cut off. China
has her Diana, her Æolus, her Ceres, her Esculapius,
her Mars, her Mercury, her Neptune, and her Pluto,
as well as the western Pagans had. To use their
own expression, ' her gods are in number hke the
sands of Havy river.' She has gods celestial,
terrestrial, and subterraneous—gods of the hills, of the
valleys, of the woods, of the districts, of the family,


* In his Retrospect of the First Ten Years of the Protestant
Mission to China, p. 28.
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 56 -->
of the shop, and of the kitchen. She adores the gods
who are supposed to preside over the thunder, the
rain, the fire; over the grain; over births and deaths,
and over the small-pox. She also worships the genii
of the mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas, together with
birds, beasts, and fishes."


\"Astrology, divination, geomancy, and
necromancy, every where prevail; spells and charms every
one possesses."


As might be expected, the god of wealth is the
most popular deity among the tradesmen and
merchants. He is represented with a wedge of gold in
one hand.


On the door of their houses a figure is painted,
which they call the god of the door. His protection
is deemed of incalculable importance to the family.
The inscription of his name is often employed as a
substitute.


To a foreigner, the compressed feet of many of
the woman met in the streets of Canton, is an object
of much curiosity. That human nature would admit
of such a distortion, or robbery, or rather both
together, I could not have imagined. The smallest
are said, by the Chinese, to be but three inches in
length; four is certainly not an unfrequent size. In
fact they do not deserve the name of feet, for there is
nothing but the great toe—if the term great may be
applied to such an object—left in its natural position;
all the others being wrested from their appointed place
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 57 -->
and office, bent under the ball of the foot, and there
made to answer the purpose of its sole. This accounts
for their painful and unnatural gait. The ancle, in
many cases, is not, as has been generally asserted,
enlarged. This custom, though by no means universal,
is not restricted to the higher circles of society.
Women in the most straitened circumstances, often
in mendicant poverty, are seen waddling with careful
steps in pursuit of their daily support. These,
however, are said to have been reduced in pecuniary
circumstances.


The fraternity of beggars are objects of true
compassion, and thrust themselves into notice at
Canton. This class is very numerous in China; and,
whether an indispensable requisite for office, or a
necessary appeal to the sympathies of a Chinaman,
there are very few exceptions to universal and total
blindness. When alone, each feels his way with
a stick, but frequently a number string themselves
in a row, and depend upon the sagacity of one blind
leader, or the more favoured eyes of a youthful
guide. The success of their application depends
upon the skilful use of bamboo sticks, iron pans,
musical instruments, and their own vocal powers;
and such is the force of custom, that, when they
enter a house, they are never expelled until their
object is gained. It is good policy not to be too
hasty in acceding to their requests, otherwise the
same grating application is likely to be forthwith  
  
  
  d5
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 58 -->
repeated by a successor, who takes care that there
shall be no long pause in the music. Groups of
them frequently assemble, and set up a concert of
all their instruments in one place. On some days
there is scarcely a shop from which these sounds do
not proceed.


One company of them sally forth at twilight, and
go the round of some of the principal streets
contiguous to the factories, including the walk in front
of the foreign buildings. Their application is usually
chaunted in mournful strains, and the whole region
is made vocal by their numerous and dissonant voices.
A Chinaman is stationed before the factories, ycleped
\"king of the beggars," who preserves order among
them in his dominions.


There is said to be an organized association of
beggars in Canton, consisting of about one thousand
members, and bearing the epithet of " The Heavenly
Flower Society." These pay a fee of admittance,
bind themselves to certain rules, and when disobedient
incur a severe penalty. The Government recognizes
a head man among them, who is made accountable
for the conduct of the whole community. Still lower
in the scale of human degradation are a few of the
most loathsome and miserable beings I ever beheld.
With matted hair, bodies partially incrusted with
dirt and covered with vermin, and but a tattered
mat to conceal their nakedness, they wander about,
eating the rejected offals of fish and vegetables, and
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 59 -->
lodging on whatever heap of rubbish they may
stumble upon when sleepy. Some of them are
outcast lepers, who are obliged by law to wear a peculiar
hat, and mat around the shoulders, to designate them
as objects of infection. (See Leviticus xiii. 45.)


Surrounded by the city, or the unwalled town,
which has been described, and in a line with the
river, are the factories assigned to the foreign
residents in Canton. They are separated from the shore
of the river by the largest, and almost the only, open
space in the vicinity. The two occupied by the
agents of the Dutch and English Companies have
extensive verandahs in front, and walks enclosed by
high walls to the water's edge. Most of them
are built in a row, and extend about a hundred
yards in front. A street and a large projecting
building, occupied by one of the Hong merchants,
separate this row from others, known by the
name of the French and Danish factories. All the
factories extend in blocks to an irregular depth, and
are separately occupied by merchants and visitors.
The communication is an avenue, generally through
the lower story of each, or between distinct
compartments. The appearance of these buildings is
quite imposing, especially when contrasted with the
neighbourhood.


The open space before the factories is the
rendezvous of multitudes ofthe natives, who assemble daily,
to transact business, gratify curiosity, or kill time,
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 60 -->
It is level for a short distance; beyond which it
stretches over a large pile of rubbish, deposited here
after the desolating fire of 1822, and retained,
notwithstanding numerous applications for its removal,
as a lasting and growing nuisance to foreigners.


When the morning opens upon this scene, silence
is atan end, and the ears of the stranger are assailed
by a most peculiar combination of sounds. Human
voices of harsh, drawling tones; cries of confined
dogs and cats; screams of roughly handled poultry;
notes of feathered songsters, some of them admirably
gifted and trained; with, at times, an accompaniment
of very unmusical instruments—all unite in this
inharmonious concert.


The occupations of the tradesmen are varied.
Meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, drugs, manufactures—
every thing saleable—is brought to this general
market. Many of them convey their portable kitchens
hither, and prepare such dishes as suit the palates
and purses of this promiscuous assembly. Others
plant their barber's shop, or its necessary apparatus,
in a convenient place, and spend their leisure hours
in conversation and lolling about. Those who
frequent the place for trade are less numerous probably
than the groups of idlers, who pass their time in
listening to stories, witnessing juggling tricks,
attending the operations and lectures of empirics, gaping
at objects of novelty, and, too frequently,
endeavouring to obtain each other's money by gambling.
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 61 -->

When the sun is oppressive the crowd retires,
with the exception of the hucksters, who intercept
his scorching beams by temporary tilts. The erection
of tents is a liberty not sanctioned by law, or, rather,
contrary to the oral prohibitions of the petty officers
who have the square in charge. Consequently, when
men of authority make their appearance the scene
suddenly changes. There is the most hasty dispatch,
from the first moment of alarm, until every thing
is removed that militates against their orders. Their
exit is regarded as the signal for restoration, and all
things speedily revert to their former state. This
pretended subjection, joined with real contempt for
authority when it opposes individual gain, is said to
be a prominent feature of the nation.


The projecting building referred to above as the
only one in the row occupied by Chinamen, is so
situated as to throw its shade, as the sun declines,
directly before the American hong. This is the place
of general concourse from the middle of the
afternoon until evening, and the crowd being then most
concentrated, the clamour is quite deafening. Neither
is the darkness of night always attended with its
appropriate stillness; for, though the rabble of the
day disperses, there is another company, consisting
chiefly of the coolies of the factories, who, with a
few noisy cooks, anxious to apprize the
neighbourhood of their presence, continue their conversations
and engagements until a late hour.
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 62 -->

The insatiable curiosity of many who appear daily
before the factories, is both amusing and annoying.
Groups of strangers frequently visit the square, and,
probably from having previously no correct idea of the
style of the buildings and the appearance of foreigners,
they gaze upon every novel object with a fixedness
of posture and vision like that of statues. If you
expose yourself to view in the verandah, they generally
stand right before it; and if you walk in front ofthe
buildings, they linger as near your track as possible,
and continue to stare as though riveted by a magic
spell. Though tumultuous, there is, in general, very
little contention among this concourse. The least
appearance of an unlawful commotion calls forth a
public officer, who resides for the purpose in full
view, and who is exceedingly efficient in quelling a
riot and scattering offenders. When occasion requires,
he summons to his aid one or two lictors, who, armed
with scourges, and apparently vested with a
discretionary power in using them, occasion a precipitate
retreat. The guilty are frequently chased, and, when
caught, dragged along to the hall of justice by their
pendant cues, which are cruelly drawn over the front
of the head, and made to press the face toward the
ground.


In surveying this mass of accountable beings, there
are many points of great interest to attract the eye of
Christian compassion and benevolence.
Independently of those common to all the heathen, there are
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 63 -->
facts of importance peculiar to this daily throng.
Great numbers of- them can read, and do read every
publication that meets their eyes. It is customary to
paste up advertisements in the most public places of
the square and the streets, and the groups generally
found throughout the day gathered round them prove
their eagerness to catch at every piece of information.
Many of these hand-bills set forth the pretensions of
quacks, and are often of such an immoral character
as to prove that God has indeed * given the people
up to vile affections " who can endure them. What
a place for the operations of a press sacred to the cause
ofthe Redeemer!


Another fact of interest is, that this daily multitude
consists of persons from different parts of the interior,
as well as from the immediate vicinity. If business or
pleasure brings them to the city, they can scarcely
possess the curiosity of the nation if they return
without a visit to the thirteen hongs, as they term
the foreign buildings.


How far the missionary would be allowed to
proceed in his intercourse with the natives, or whether
those obstacles which are considered insuperable by
some, would not, if they do really exist, yield to a little
courage and perseverance, remains to be tested. One
rule of action among the Chinese, which should never
be forgotten by those who labour for their best interests,
is, that they seldom, if ever, grant a request, for the
most trifling thing, when applied to; and very seldom
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 64 -->
oppose, or persist in opposing, any reasonable
attempt, if a little determination and fearlessness is
evinced.


The necessity of having the Scriptures translated,
and other preparatory works of indispensable
importance accomplished, have not only consumed the time
of the senior missionary, but obliged him to leave
experiments to those whose presence could be more
easily dispensed with—who have not the first toils of
a mission before them.


It has been mentioned that the Choo-keang, or
Pearl river, runs in front of the factories, and forms
the southern boundary of Canton. In passing to and
from the shipping I had a favourable opportunity of
viewing the numerous boats, which on our arrival
were partially obscured by the shades of night.
The magic appearance of the first evening had
nearly vanished. It was evident that from ignorance
as to the locality of the city, some of the lights on
shore bad been imagined to be in the boats, and the
level site of the city mistaken for extensive water
scenery. Yet enough remained to attract and distract
the attention, and to keep the mind in a glowof
excitement. The boats are much more numerous abreast of
the city, and opposite the villages bordering on the
river, than in the intervening waters. These are, for the
most part, the residencesof families; and as the owners
of many of them are employed on shore, they are
kept more stationary than the others. This, however,
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 65 -->
is not so much the result of choice, or inability on the
part of the women to manage their boats, as it is the
want of an adequate inducement to change their
position. Even children of both sexes, as soon as
they are capable of assisting, are taught to labour to
the extent of their strength; so that the absence of
the father and husband is no preventive to any
undertaking, that is sufficiently profitable. When the
parties are dependent for a livelihood upon the hire
of their boats, women appear to labour quite as
diligently as the men; by which means they acquire
all the dexterity and endurance, and, I may add,
coarseness, of which human nature is susceptible.
It is not uncommon to see them tugging at the oar
with an infant tied to their backs, and its head, if
feeble, keeping time to the motion of the mother's
body.


Such is the multitude and density of these
dwellings in some favourite regions, that they often conceal
a large surface of the element on which they rest,
and appear jumbled together in a solid mass. In
other places they are arranged with contiguous
sides, and extend from each shore, leaving about a
third of the river clear. Groups of them are often
detached from the land and moored in regular
rows; affording the means of communication among
themselves, and preventing intercourse with the
shore. Besides these family boats, there are many
others, of much larger dimensions, which are employed
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 66 -->
in conveying articles of commerce between Canton
and different parts of the empire


Strange vessels generally select the centre of the
river for an anchorage, and, yielding to the force ofa
powerful current, range in the direction of the stream.
Besides these clusters of vessels, there are numbers
of insulated crafts, of different sizes, scattered on
all sides, and equally tending to obstruct the passage
of the river. In fact, it is necessary to keep a sharp
look-out, and to steer, in some places, the most
crooked course, to avoid coming in contact with
stationary and moving boats. One class of these
dwellings, and it comprises a large number, is
composed of the sties of a degraded portion of the
community, many of whom, it is said, are early sold,
by their inhuman parents, to perpetual infamy and
wretchedness. These are distinguished from all the
rest by the superior style of their structure and
embellishments.


It is a singular fact, that the Chinese look upon
those who dwell in boats as a distinct race from
themselves. They consider them as low people, and
aliens, and refuse to intermarry with them. Tradition
says that they came from outside the mouth of the
river. The grandfather of the present emperor was
the first who naturalized them. Before his time they
were not permitted to land.


Neither is the whole of the water population
confined to floating residences. Houses erected on piles,
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 67 -->
and superior to the ordinary influence of wind and
tide, extend in some places a considerable distance
from the shore opposite to Canton. Between the
villages, as has been stated, the boats are less
numerous; but, as might be supposed, there are
numbers constantly passing, besides many engaged
in fishing, or whatever employment may offer along
the shore. Their vessels of war indicate either an
amicable disposition, a friendly neighbourhood, or
a great deficiency of skill in naval architecture. The
strength of their materials would give them an
advantage in defensive warfare; but they are built
on an antiquated and clumsy plan, and calculated
neither to contend with a tumultuous sea, nor to
confront a modern foe.


Besides these, a number of galliots are
employed by government, to defend the trade, and
prevent the depredations of the ladrones, or pirates,
by whom the rivers and coasts were formerly much
infested. These are well built, and generally manned
by as many rowers as can occupy the seats and
employ the oars with advantage. Superstition, or
old custom, has furnished them all with eyes *.
Their conductors, however, appear capable of seeing
but one object, and in the pursuit of that they
stop not to inquire whether friend or foe suffers. All


* Every Chinese bo;'.t of any size, has two large eyes painted,
one on each side of the bow.
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 68 -->
these unprincipled officers of Government can be
bribed, and that to the connivance, and even
prosecution, of a traffic (the opium trade) which is not
only interdicted by the laws of the country, but is
the destruction of its vital interests.


Among these fluviatic tribes, every convenience of
land, as well as water, is enjoyed. Eatables, materials
for sacrifice, and other articles of equal demand, are
furnished to their hand; while barbers, play-actors,
and all who can reap advantage by administering to
their comfort or amusement, pursue the same system
of mutual accommodation.


The appearance of the river is by no means an
incorrect barometer, indicating especially those great
changes in the atmosphere which are subjects of
apprehension to these experienced weather spies.
The difference between the water scenery in a fair
day, and a storm, or the prospect of a gale, is very
striking. One would scarcely believe that the
numbers who appear so thickly congregated in
different parts of the river in good weather, could
crowd into the compass which confines them when
danger is feared. In times of apprehension the river
appears as clear as those of other countries; its
width is still, however, considerably contracted by
the boats closely ranged along the shores.


Of all the different descriptions of craft, there are
very few destitute of shrines, images, or inscriptions
of some kind, and the necessary apparatus for their
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 69 -->
daily offerings. Every morning and evening, and
whenever evils are deprecated or special blessings craved,
they fly to their altar, apply a piece of consecrated
paper, oiled for the purpose, to the burning lamp or
incense-stick, and, when it blazes, throw it into the
water, and bow to the imaginary spirit of the deep.


By a recent statement, the number of family boats
subject to an annual tax, in the vicinity of Canton
alone, is computed at fifty thousand; while the larger
vessels employed between Canton and Whampoa are
estimated at eighteen thousand more. Neither does
this give us a full view of the vast number of
perishing idolaters who inhabit the waters of this region.
The amount is greatly swelled by the men employed
in the large canal boats, which ply between this port
and different parts of the interior; and by the crews
of the junks employed in the coasting trade, numbers
of which are constantly lying in the harbour. A
communication is kept up between Canton and every
part of the empire; and if the former maintain its
commercial advantages, and receive from Christians
the attention it merits, it must become one of the
most important mission stations in the world.


One of the principal modes of recreation among
foreigners, is rowing and sailing in small boats, which
they keep for the purpose. In these excursions it
is often necessary to pass through fleets of native
craft; and thus to come in contact with crowds of
persons, who might be taught and furnished with
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 70 -->
books. It is true they evince a shyness towards
foreigners, which may be partially inspired by the
officers of Government; but it is a question whether
this might not be overcome by a little perseverance,
and whether, when conversing with them became a
common practice, it would not cease to awaken

suspicion.


Opposite to Canton is the island of Hainam, so
called from its situation on the south side of the
river. Here we have been in the habit of taking
an occasional ramble, it being the only place in the
immediate neighbourhood where country scenery can
be enjoyed. After passing through a number of
narrow, filthy lanes, you emerge into an extensive
champaign, and have the liberty of wandering as far
as health or inclination dictates.


The land is generally low, partially inundated by
the tide waters, and devoted to the cultivation of rice,
for which it is well adapted. Where its surface is not
too level and saturated, it is arranged in terraces, and
planted with a great variety of vegetables, ginger, a
species of indigo, &.c. The fields are divided by ridges,
which answer the purpose of walks, and are generally
flagged with a coarse granite. With the exception
of a very few scattered houses, the farmers reside in
villages surrounded with walls. These villages we
have often approached; though at times it has been
necessary to avoid them, to keep without the reach
of the stones and dirt with which the boys
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 71 -->
occasionally annoyed us. Almost every piece of rising
ground is consecrated to the burial of the dead, and
the vast multitudes crowded together in these
spacious cemetries proclaim the dominion of the king
of terrors. We were interested in the examination
of the bridges thrown across the natural and
artificial streams; the strength of their materials, and
firmness of their structure, appeared as though they
had survived, and would long defy, the waste of
ages. Some of the slabs of granite were twenty-four
feet in length.


But the greatest object of curiosity is the large
Pagan establishment belonging to the sect of Budh.
It is situated near the margin of the river, is enclosed
by a wall, and includes within its limits an area of
many acres. On entering the gate the eye is
arrested by a few majestic banyans, which appear to
have withstood the storms of centuries, and found a
congenial soil within these sacred precincts. Passing
up a central walk, the avenue leads through two
buildings, a short distance apart, in each of which
are seated colossal figures, intended as warders to
the temple. The countenance and attitude of some
of them are intended to express the deepest rage.
A little farther are two buildings, directly opposite
to each other, to which flagged walks branch off
from the main avenue. These contain a number
of famous military demigods, one of whom has been
adopted as the patron deity of the reigning family.
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 72 -->
After this come successively three large halls,
interrupting the central walk, and containing a variety
of idols, of different dimensions and appearances. In
one of them are seated three huge figures, designed
to illustrate the triune manifestations of Budh,—the
past, present, and future. Eighteen images, the
disciples of Budh, are arranged on each side of the
hall. " The Manchou Tartar family, on the throne
of China," say its monarchs, " are these disciples of
Budh appearing again on the stage of the world."
Such are their ideas ofthe metempsychosis.


Each of these principal halls contains a number of
ornamental pillars. Their roofs are generally made
to project, with the low and convex sweep of
primitive architecture, and decorated with grotesque
monsters intended to represent dragons and lions.


Besides these principal buildings, there are others,
situated on each side of the enclosed space, employed
as cells for lodging, a dining apartment, idol halls, a
printing room, pens for animals, and all that is
necessary for the support of their worship and
themselves. Their library contains books of many sizes
and forms, chiefly prayers untranslated from the Pali,
or sacred language.


No free-will offering to their gods is considered
more acceptable than living domestic animals
liberally supported till they die. These are most
carefully preserved and feasted, until choked with fat, or
worn out with age. The eyes of some of the hogs
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 73 -->
are entirely concealed; a deep crevice indicates the
place oftheir interment.


The whole number of priests belonging to the
establishment is between one and two hundred.
There is evidently a great distinction of ranks among
them. Some are respectable in appearance, and
much respected; others are clothed in rags, and beg
about the streets of Canton.


We saw about seventy engaged in their daily
devotions, in one of the largest halls. The youngest
was about twelve years of age, and the eldest
verging on threescore and ten. They were all dressed
in their robes, and spent about an hour in droning
their cabalistic words, aided and timed by the beat of
metal vessels. During the hour, they were alternately
kneeling, knocking their heads, standing, bowing,
and walking in single file round the hall.


The whole spectacle was calculated to impress a
feeling heart with compassion. It was deeply
affecting to see so many, apparently in the last stage of
this probationary existence, trusting to a delusion
which, had impressed its own unmeaningness upon
their countenances, while the younger ones were
early imbibing the same stupifying lesson.


In all our rambles through the country and villages
of Hainam, there has been nothing to discourage the
hope, that, having the ability of communicating with
the natives, we might tax our strength to the utmost
in teaching them the " glad tidings of great joy."  
  
  
  E
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 74 -->

For some days after our arrival we were visited by
crowds of merchants and mechanics, whose object
none could mistake. Of course their principal
business is with our mercantile fellow-passengers. They
generally understand a little English, but their
vocabulary is so limited and corrupt that it is at first
impossible to comprehend their meaning. With the
exception of two or three, who have spent some time
in England or America, there is probably not one of
their number to whom even simple ideas expressed
in correct diction would be intelligible. There must
be a system of mutual accommodation, or nothing
can be done with them.


Some of the most familiar vocables in this strange
compound belong neither to correct Chinese, English,
nor Portuguese, but are a corruption of each, with
an admixture ofa few other words, said by
philologists to be traceable to no language, living or dead.
Many of our syllables have sounds to which their
organs of speech have never been trained; and
consequently, when uttered by them, they appear so unlike
themselves as not to be recognised by their old and
best acquaintance.


Their own idiom is retained in some cases, and a
literal translation of words attempted, which, from the
great difference of structure and figurative allusion
in the two languages, would frequently convey to the
mind of a novice any idea as readily as the one
intended.
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 75 -->

The appearance of these men, and of tlie Chinese
in general, both male and female, differs in some
respects from rny pre-conceived notions. Those
peculiarities which are the most striking to the stranger
are, the great variety of complexion, the general
flatness of face and uniformity of features, and especially
the strange formation of the eye, not only with its
internal angle curved, as has been noticed by other
writers, but with the lid in many cases so small as
to appear unfit for its natural use. This last
peculiarity is most remarkable among children. The
lid appears unnaturally distended when the eye is
open; at the same time it covers so much of the ball
of the eye as to produce the impression that the
latter is uncomfortably confined. With the exception
of the occiput, the heads of the men are shaved : in
that region, if its luxuriance will admit, it is permitted
to grow until it comes in contact with their heels. In
this province it is worn in a pendant plait; the cords
with which it is interwoven frequently supplying the
deficiency of its length. It is quite a comment on
fashion—" old custom," as the Chinese term it—to
compare with the popularity and prevalence of the
one here described, the recency of its date and the
reproach of its origin. Upon the Tartar conquest,
not two centuries ago, the Chinese were compelled to
adopt this style of wearing their hair, as a mark of
subjugation. Many considered it such a disgrace
that they preferred losing their heads to their hair:  
  
  
  e 2
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 76 -->
now it has become an ornament, and a mark of proud
distinction.


The girls wear the long plait, after the fashion
of the men, but do not shave the other parts ofthe
head. After marriage the hair is braided upon the
head, and decked with a profusion of flowers and
jewels, according to the rank or means of the
possessor. The ordinary style of dress of both sexes is
nearly alike : it consists of loose pantaloons, and an
over-garment, or robe, with long dangling sleeves,
which varies in length from the knee to the ground.
Their girdles, like those of the Jews, frequently
answer the purpose of purses. Their stockings have no
reference to the shape or size of the limbs; and their
shoes have thick, clumsy soles, turning up in front,
and destitute of that elasticity which gives a spring
in walking.
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 77 -->
  
  CHAPTER IV.  
  
  
  CHINA — CONTINUED.

Having made these general remarks upon the country
and its inhabitants, we pass on to relate a few of those
incidents which occurred at the time, and which will
give some idea of a residence in China. Two facts,
however, must be borne in mind: the first is, that
the writer did not immediately enter upon the duties
of a foreign missionary, but devoted the chief part of
his time to those who spoke his own language, at
Canton and Whampoa. His first engagement was
with the American-Seamen's Society. The second
consideration is, that, during his residence at Canton,
he knew nothing of the language, and was
consequently unable to avail himself of those opportunities
of usefulness which were almost daily presented.
This will account for the dearth of that kind of
intelligence which is to be found in most other
missionary journals.


March lst.—Yesterday (Sabbath), pursuant to
public notice, which is generally hung up on a small
board before the factory, Divine service was performed
in the large room of the building in which we reside.
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 78 -->
This is the place where Dr. Morrison has been in the
habit of preaching for the last two seasons. A chapel
attached to the factory occupied by the English
Company, is also open every Sabbath morning for the
worship of God. Besides these, Dr. M. has a Chinese
service every Lord's-day in his own room.


Among the number of our attendants was Ah-see,
a Chinese known to many in America; who spent
several years in the United States, was partially
educated at Cornwall, and publicly professed the
Christian faith in New York. How far he has
maintained his Christian integrity I am unable to say.
He is evidently familiar with " the speech of Canaan,"
but there is reason to fear that his long separation
from all religious society and external restraints, has
proved unfavourable to the progress of his personal
piety. One unfavourable symptom is the distance at
which he keeps from those who might be ofthe most
service to him, as well as the apparent indifference with
which he regards the condition of his countrymen.
Still there may be some danger of judging
uncharitably, as very little is known of his private life.


We met this evening at the room of Dr. M. for
the monthly social prayer in behalf of missions.
Though none were present but ourselves, it was
gratifying to know that the voice of prayer, if begun
by us, would not die, at least in the ears of the Lord,
until thousands in other lands swelled the petition,
and rolled it almost " the world around." One fact
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 79 -->
encouraged us, with respect to the conversion of
China. Whenever the Gospel gains access, it must
have, according to all appearance, a speedy and wide
circulation. There is no moral power to confront
it. The religion of the empire is baseless; nothing
appears to support it but one vast scaffold of
ignorance, which, it is believed, can withstand no shock,
and, when it yields, must bury the whole fabric in one
common grave.


March 15th.—On Saturday Capt. Lavender came
to town, with the intention of taking me with him in
the afternoon to Whampoa; but this was prevented
by a long-continued shower. I arose early on Sabbath
morning, and reached the ship before breakfast. The
Bethel flag soon waved in the breeze, and the silent
invitation was answered by an unusually large number
from the two American vessels in port.


This morning was spent in visiting two of the
three islands contiguous to the shipping, and
accessible to foreigners. They are known by the names of
Whampoa, French, and Dane's Islands. Here,
strangers enjoy the liberty of exercising their limbs,
if they confine themselves within certain limits; and
of burying their dead, if they comply with the
exorbitant demands of the avaricious and calculating
proprietors. Isa sufficient number are together, they
may extend their ramble almost at pleasure; but the
probability of defeat, or the fear of personal injury,
is the only certain security from an attack by the
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 80 -->
natives. The solitary adventurer is not always
molested, but it is always wise to decline the
experiment, since the younger part of the community are
allowed by their parents to pelt him with stones and
mud, and "children of a larger growth" are not
backward to take from his pockets, or even from his
person, whatever may tempt their avarice, or take their
fancy. A short time since an imprudent stranger
exposed himself to their cupidity, and was robbed
of his watch.


It should not be concealed, that the conduct of
sailors, permitted to enjoy their liberty on these
islands, has been highly offensive to the Chinese.
Maddened by the fumes of a vile liquor distilled from
rice, and mixed, it is said, with poisonous ingredients,
the crews of some of the ships have even gone to the
extreme of sacrilege, assailing their very temples, and
abusing their gods.


French island is a vast cemetry, where multitudes
of natives and foreigners await the morning of the
resurrection. Here are three groups of graves of
foreigners, occupying different places, though but a
short distance apart. The two most contiguous to
the present anchorage are of recent date, and are
principally those of Americans and English. The
inscriptions on the tombs of the other group are in
different languages, and refer you, with a few
exceptions, to the past century. The majority were cut
off in the morning of life—a solemn admonition to
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 81 -->
thoughtless youth. It is singular, that those who
fall from the ships, however expert they may be at
swimming, and even accustomed to exercise that art
in this very river, seldom rise to the surface, or are
rescued from the grasp of death. Some attribute this
to an under-current of resistless power; but those who
are in the habit of diving for pleasure experience no
difficulty in rising to the surface. Many a mound is
pointed out where sleep the bodies of those who
were healthy, gay, unapprehensive of their change,
the very moment before it occurred. In the midst of
cheerful conversation there was an abrupt pause—a
sudden plunge—an awful eternity.


Those foreigners who die at Canton are generally
interred on this island; and it appears that Death
has been peculiarly triumphant during the last year.
One of our party, who had just returned from a
trading voyage, read the epitaph of two of his
acquaintance, to whom he bade adieu one year ago in
perfect health. The first intimations of their death
he received, with astonishment, within a short
distance of their mouldering remains.


Besides the number of strangers who have found
their grave in this heathen land, many of the hills
are repositories of deceased natives. The sepulchres
of the rich and great are generally constructed of
hewn stone, in a semi-circular or horse-shoe form,
corresponding in appearance to the previous rank
or circumstances of the lowly tenant. Some of  
  
  
  e 5
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 82 -->
them are quite ornamental to the hill on which they
are placed.


According to the superstitious custom of the
Chinese, they have just been paying their annual visit
to their departed relatives; repairing the tombs;
decorating the surrounding spot with coloured papers;
offering sacrifices to their manes; and attending to
numerous rites, which they conceive to be becoming
in the living, and not only gratifying to the dead, but
quite necessary to their comfort. The more wealthy
erect, on these occasions, booths on the hills, assemble
their kindred, prepare a sumptuous entertainment,
provide candles, incense, gold and silver paper, suits
of clothes, and other articles; which, being converted
by the operation of fire into smoke, pass, they
imagine, into the world of spirits. Then they kneel,
and pray to this effect: " We, a multitude of children,
grand-children, and other descendants, now—on such
a day—have come hitherto worship at our ancestors'
tumuli. We pray, that, by the protection of our
ancestors, we may become prosperous, and that their
descendants may be constantly supported." At this
season the bones are removed, if the body is supposed
to occupy an inauspicious place. Even those who
profess to believe the doctrine of spiritual
annihilation, or metempsychosis, are among the most
scrupulous in their offerings to the dead.


It appears to be a very prevailing opinion that
the spirit, or one of the spirits—as they believe in a
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 83 -->
plurality—continues in the vicinity of the
dispossessed body; that the sympathy between them
remains almost as perfect as before their separation;
and that the comfort of the living agent is materially
affected by the regard shewn to it, or to its decaying
companion, by earthly relatives. The idea of having
none to sacrifice at their tombs, and supply them with
such things as they are supposed to need in the
invisible state, is abhorrent to a Chinaman.


One great inducement for keeping up these
ceremonies with so much apparent zest, is the scene of
feasting and revelry which ensues. If the description
applies with peculiar emphasis to any people in the
world, " whose God is their belly," it does to the
Chinese. This is the exhaustless theme of their
conversation. " Have you eaten? " is one of the most
common and polite salutations among them; and
the reputation of a good liver appears to excite
both the envy and respect of their less favoured
countrymen.


We visited a sugar establishment on the island
of Whampoa. The simplicity and cheapness of the
works were highly characteristic of Chinese taste and
policy. The mill, which expresses the liquor from the
cane, was composed of three vertical cylinders, made
of a coarse granite, with wooden cogs. The coppers,
as boilers are termed in other sugar-growing countries
of less primitive predilections, were made of cast
iron, which they have the art of reducing almost to
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 84 -->
the texture of common paper, and of welding, when
cracked or broken, with entire facility and firmness.
These were arranged triangularly, and with little
apparent regard to those principles of granulation
which are elsewhere adopted. That nothing might
reduce the quantum of manual labour, where hands
and mouths are so numerous and wages so low, the
mill was placed below the level ofthe boilers, and the
liquor carried in tubs from the one to the other. As
it attained its consistence in each of these vessels,
instead of being passed through a strainer into thc
next, it was transferred by hand to another part of
the building, whence, after the process of filtration,
it was returned to its appropriate caldron.


The Chinamen were very civil and obliging. They
gathered round; invited us to gratify our curiosity
and palates; and, presuming on equal liberties,amused
themselves in examining our persons and dress.
Every article of apparel was scrutinized, and when
the eye was not sufficiently discriminating, the aid of
the fingers was called in. Here again we have had
repeated opportunities of intercourse with the natives,
and, had we known the language, might have turned
it to the best account.


March 20th.—Our attention has been frequently
arrested by processions passing through the streets.
Sometimes they are the retinue of men of distinction,
whose approach is announced by a herald beating a
gong in a peculiar manner; and who move about with
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 85 -->
all the display of badges, servants, and equestrian
attendants, of which their civil and literary rank will
admit. The sumptuary laws of the empire forbid
that parade of mere wealth which is common in other
countries, although the liberty of purchasing nominal
titles and immunities gives nearly as much
importance to wealth as though such a statute was not in
existence. One thing, however, detracts from that
conscious security in his possessions which the man
of property enjoys under the laws of Christian lands :
there are offices above the nominal rank to which wealth
can raise its possessor; and these offices are frequently
filled by men who, with the love of money and
contempt of justice so common in China, can generally
manage to stock their own coffers at the expense
of their unprotected neighbours. Occasions can be
seized upon where they exist, or feigned where they
have no existence, by the skilful management of
which these officers of injustice can effect their most
avaricious and nefarious purposes.


But to return from this digression.—The
processions most worthy of remark are either designed for
religious, hymeneal, or funeral occasions. Were it
not for a few characteristic objects in one part of the
train, it would be impossible for a stranger to
determine whether it was designed to honour the gods,
feast the living, or gratify the dead. The
appearance of the attendants, the style of the music, the
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 86 -->
ornaments, and the eatables, are generally the
same.


Some of their burials exhibit a great shew of
mourning; but as this is known to be the custom in
China, and to be connected with other established
usages—such as preserving the body of the deceased
until the ordinary fountain of grief is staunched, and
calling to their assistance " such as are skilful of
lamentation"—it fails to excite the sympathy due to
genuine sorrow. The greatest ceremony is made at the
funeral of a parent, when the nearest male relative
walks immediately behind the body, and is obliged
to be supported in the phrensy of his professed grief.
The death of a wife is considered a matter of much
less importance : the husband on that occasion
walks in an erect posture, and with an air of
comparative indifference.


The mourning habit is something ofa light brown,
with a napkin of the same colour tied round the head.
Sackcloth is often worn. The mourner, if not too poor,
keeps himself in deep retirement for a hundred days;
the beard and hair are allowed to grow, and other acts
of cleanliness and comfort are dispensed with: all
this being designed to shew the absorption of his
grief, and, consequently, his estimate of the loss he
has sustained. Among the Chinese, the death of a
father or mother disqualifies a son for office for three
years; the Tartars mourn a hundred days.
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 87 -->

The bridal palanquin and paraphernalia designate
the marriage procession. The former is exceedingly
gaudy, and, I believe, employed only on this
occasion; the latter is said to be the only dowry of
the females. It consists of furniture, apparel, wines,
eatables, and, at times, boxes of money. Of course
the profusion and splendour vary according to the
capacity ofthe father's purse and heart. The
palanquin is generally attended by a few females, the
\"handmaids " of the enclosed; but so closely is it
shut on every side, that it is impossible, by any
contrivance, to catch a glimpse of the contents. The same
ignorance is the misery of the bridegroom, when he
beholds the vehicle approaching, and reflects that it
contains the unknown companion of his future life.


The largest procession I have yet seen, passed
to-day. Its object was religious, in commemoration
of the birth-day of one of their gods—probably a
deified hero. To describe it would be difficult; to
imagine it the product of a rational mind, for any
rational purpose, still more so; but to believe it the
effort of an immortal spirit to secure the favour of
One who has the disposal of its eternal happiness,
almost impossible.


Among the objects which principally attracted our
attention, were small temples fantastically decorated,
and furnished with gilded images; pageants
resembling open palanquins, and filled with roasted pigs,
ornamented fruits, cakes, and flowers; boys and girls
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 88 -->
arrayed, on horseback—-the first, children of
wealthy parents, who represent official attendants
upon the gods; the second, holding the sacred
vessels of their altars, and acting as priestesses;—
groups of lads on foot, occupying different places in
the procession, and each company wearing a distinct
uniform; bands of musicians, both aged and young,
with gongs, drums, tamborines, cymbals, stringed
and wind instruments; besides a large number of
coolies, in almost every colour and style of dress,
each furnished with a religious tablet, or ornament
of some kind. The tout ensemble was not unlike the
display, on a day of general militia muster, in some
ofthe populous towns in America, when the different
companies, arrayed in their peculiar uniform, down
to the unmilitary ragamuffins, as multiform in their
dress as in their arms, join in one general parade, and
lend all that is imposing—at least in variety—to the
long-drawn and ludicrous spectacle. The resemblance
is even more striking in the spirit than in the
appearance of these two motley groups, convened for such
different objects. If the Chinese had been enraged
at their deity, and intended this as a public expression
of their contempt, it would have been more in
character. Such is the phrensy of the human mind,
without the restraining and renewing powers of the
Holy Spirit.


March 25th.—Dr. Moirison sent for us this
evening, to meet Leang Asa at his rooms. This man,
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 89 -->
as is generally known, is among the first-fruits of the
mission to China; and if the promise respecting the
Jews be applicable to the Chinese, and the multitude
composing " the lump " be individually as holy as
\"the first-fruits," we may expect a glorious harvest
from this neglected part of the Saviour's promised
vineyard. Since his conversion he has been greatly
persecuted, and is daily " counted worthy to suffer
shame for His name." Active and undaunted in the
service of his Master, he has been seized, imprisoned,
spoiled of his goods, and scourged. His daily business,
notwithstanding the rage of his enemies and the
revilings of his friends, is to preach and teach Jesus
Christ " from house to house." He appears to
possess the spirit of a martyr; and we have reason to
hope is prepared, if necessary, to meet a martyr's
death. The feelings he expressed, in welcoming us as
missionaries to his benighted country, were awakened
in our bosoms at the sight of one in whom appeared
so distinctly the image of the Saviour.


He read the tenth chapter of Luke in Chinese,
and explained, with much propriety, the passage
respecting the harvest and labourers. The interview
was closed by a solemn and earnest petition, in his
own language; which, before rising from our knees,
was translated for our edification by Dr. M., and
offered to "the same Lord over all." We were
told, that all his prayers are so different from the
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 90 -->
set phraseology of the formalist, and so feelingly
adapted to circumstances, that they carry with them
the evidence of their origin and sincerity *.


April 2d.—One of the most popular amusements
in China, and one which forces itself upon our
attention at this season, is the drama. On walking
abroad, if the eyes are allowed their wonted liberty,
we are sure to see it: at home, if the ears retain the
same freedom, itself or its accompaniments will
infallibly be heard.


Stages are annually erected in the most public
and spacious openings of the streets, and frequently
on the ground of wealthy citizens. When the
exhibition is intended for the amusement of the
public, the expenses, it is said, are defrayed by the
inhabitants of that district. The rich engage these
actors for the entertainment of themselves and their
families; to do honour to their guests; and sometimes
simply to ensure success in their temporal affairs, as
they strangely connect prosperity in business with
these and many other equally silly performances.
These exhibitions are frequently intended for the
honour and gratification of their gods. The squares


* Others have been successively associated with Leang Asa,
and his last report mentions that " there are upwards of ten of us,
who, with one heart and united minds, continue to serve the Lord,
and practise the holy doctrines of the Gospel. Every Sabbath-day
we assemble together, to praise the Saviour for the mighty grace
of the redemption."
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 91 -->
belonging to some of the temples are the places most
commonly selected, and the scenes are sometimes
kept up for seven successive days and nights.


The opinion they entertain of the objects of their
adoration and trust may be gathered from the pieces
introduced for their amusement. Many of them are
of a tragic character, founded upon ancient chronicles,
and designed to perpetuate the notable events of the
empire. That these should be grateful to the deified
heroes to whom the temples are dedicated, and who
were the chief actors in the scenes described, is a
natural conclusion. But what ideas must they have of the
moral character of these honoured beings, if they
believe that their attempts at comedy, buffoonery, and
gross obscenity, are approved of and acceptable ?


The inconsistencies and puerilities which are found
in these productions are also very glaring. How the
spectators can not only endure such childish tricks,
but admire them, must be a source of wonder to those
who regard the nation as advanced beyond the mere
vaunt of superiority in taste and attainments.


Their music is, in our estimation, totally deficient
of instrumental harmony. They are fond of sounds,
have a variety of instruments, and practise sufficiently
to become proficients; but either all our ideas on the
subject are wrong, or there is very little musical talent
or taste in the nation. Their instruments are in
general differently constructed from ours, and the
musicians are not unfrequently lads, who appear in
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 92 -->
a great measure to consult their own childish whims
in the manner and pauses of their performances. In
the music which is generally heard at their
processions, one is strongly inclined to doubt whether any
thing is aimed at beyond mere noise; and their most
popular tunes, when performed by practised men,
have little in them that strikes pleasantly upon the
ear of any but Chinamen. The gong is generally
produced on every occasion which calls for music, and
there are many ceremonies, both secular and
religious, in which it is considered the only appropriate
instrument. Its loud vibratory sounds, according to
the usual mode of beating it, though considered
agreeable by some, appear to me to be on a par with
the tones ofa cracked bell, and scarcely so mellifluous.


June 24th.—One of the annual festivals has been
celebrated to-day; and the confusion of a holiday
crowd, the noise of guns, crackers, gongs, and
drums; and the display of streamers and ornaments
of almost every gaudy colour, have fatigued the
senses, and rendered the shades and silence of night
peculiarly grateful. It is in commemoration of the
death of a statesman of high respectability, who,
faithful to the office entrusted to him, was so sensitive
to the slanderous misrepresentations of his enemies,
that he threw himself into a river, and was drowned.
His name was Watune, and the event is asserted to
have taken place about two thousand three hundred
years ago.
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 93 -->

There is a custom connected with the observance
of this anniversary which proves a source both of
amusement and danger, and with which the populace
are so captivated that personal safety and legislative
prohibitions are alike disregarded. They have long
narrow shallops, curiously constructed for the
occasion, which they term dragon-boats—probably from
their serpent-like appearance—and with which they
pretend to explore the rivers and creeks for the
undiscovered bodies ofthe ancients. These contain from
sixty to a hundred men, furnished with paddles,
which they time to the beat ofthe gong and drum,
and with which they drive them forward with great
velocity. We have heard of no accident to-day,
although not unfrequently the scene is closed by a
tragedy. It is the custom to try the comparative
speed of the boats, and, inflamed with the spirit of
rivalry and the fumes of samshoo, they sometimes come
in contact, and convert their paddles into weapons
of death. Two years ago, besides running down a
number of boats and drowning men and women, one
of them was upset, and eighteen perished.


Various superstitious customs are observed on this
day. The mechanics and shopkeepers suspend their
labours, and too frequently indulge in feasting and
licentiousness.


August 9th, 1830.—After a visit of nearly three
weeks at Macao, we are again bending our course
towards the scene of our present labours. With the
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 94 -->
exception ofa prison, it would probably be difficult to
find a better preparation (or the enjoyment of verdant
scenery, invigorating breezes, bodily recreation, and
female society, than a residence at Canton.


We engaged an English sailing-boat manned by
Lascars*, and, favoured with a fine breeze, in less than
twenty-four hours reached our destination. The time
has passed rapidly and agreeably, between the
improvement of opportunities for usefulness, and the
enjoyment of those advantages which are conducive to
health. Besides the usual morning service, ordinarily
conducted by Dr. Morrison, an evening lecture was
also held at his house. The attendance much exceeded
expectation, though it was something of a novelty—
probably the first Protestant preaching ever attended
on the Lord's-day evening, in the empire of China.
Though in itself of comparatively small importance, it
opens a delightful vista into the future, and discloses
to tbe eye of faith an extended scene of gathering,
attentive, and praising multitudes, filling the thousand
temples of Jehovah which shall soon stud this land,
and scarcely capable of realizing the moral night which
shrouds our present post of observation, and through
which nothing but the lamp of prophecy sheds the
faintest ray.


That such a prospect should be considered a wild
fancy by a large proportion of mankind, who look


* Lascars are native sailors from Bengal, or other parts of India
Proper.
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 95 -->
only at things as they appear, and overlook the
determination and ability of Jehovah to make them
appear otherwise, cannot be wonderful to those who
know the influence of the senses upon the mind, and
who could have seen the spectacle of idolatry which
we witnessed during our visit at Macao.


As a remedy to the declension of trade and the
destructive fires with which the nation has been
recently visited, a famous geomancer recommended
the erection ofa new temple, to be dedicated to the
\"god of wealth, the god of the north, and the god of
fire." A subscription was opened for the purpose, and
the individual contributions varied from one to one
thousand dollars. A splendid Pagan procession
passed through the streets for ten successive days.
It was composed, each day, of distinct classes of
persons, belonging to a particular trade or
neighbourhood. Each party defrayed their own expenses, and
seemed to aim at eclipsing the pomp of their
predecessors. Being an object of engrossing interest and
not very frequent occurrence, it enlisted among its
attendants many persons from those classes of the
community which, it is said, seldom honour the gods
with their presence. As usual, there was a number
of bands of music, some of which were volunteer
companies of respectability; but never do I recollect
to have heard such grating, deafening tones, from
instruments designed for human gratification or
human endurance.
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 96 -->

Among the great variety of objects intended to
give effect to some of the processions, were young
girls, apparently standing in the air, at least with no
other visible support than the decayed branch of a
bush, held, by some, at arm's length from the body,
and furnishing to others a perch for their diminutive
feet. In the one case, the branch appeared too
feeble to sustain the weight of the body, even if the
muscles of the arm were capable of such an effort;
and, in the other, it afforded no surface on which to
balance the person, even if the vehicle beneath had been
stationary. The probability is that there was a
communication of wire, or something sufficiently tenuous
and strong, painted in imitation of decayed branches,
inclosing the body and fastened to the platform
which was carried beneath them. Their loose flowing
robes were well calculated to favour the illusion.


In one ofthe processions was a large, hideous figure,
made of painted paper, and designed to materialize
their fancy of what they term lung, or the dragon.
This creature, or deity, or both—for their systems
recognise no distinction—is supposed to exert a mighty
influence in the regions of the air. It is thought
to answer, in some respects, to the Python of the
Greeks—certainly the locality and prevalence of its
dominions is strikingly analogous to the "dragon,
that old serpent" of the true faith. Its length of
volume, which probably exceeded one hundred feet,
was supported by a number of men beneath, and
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 97 -->
partly within it, who held it upon poles, and gave the
huge monster, as it passed, the sinuous motion of its
genus. The day closed, or rather the night was
spent, in the performance of plays before the temple.
A temporary stage was erected for the occasion, and
the court richly illuminated with clusters of glass
chandeliers. Such is the solemnity and
reasonableness of pagan worship !


We are now returning, in a large native boat,
by what is termed the Inside Passage. Vast meadows
intersected by rivers and creeks, and bounded by
irregular ranges of naked hills, extend in some places
as far as the eye can reach. These are all covered
with paddy. What a beneficent provision is there in
these extensive and irrigated lands for the rice-eating
millions of China !


A light breeze bears us along, while village after
village rises to view, and recedes in the distance.
There is very little in the general aspect of the
country, or in any of its isolated objects, to awaken regret
at the impossibility of landing. The site of the
villages is generally low and level: some of them are
flanked by hills, sacred to the gods and the dead,
and all (at least through our present medium, a
heated atmosphere and languid eyes) destitute of any
attractions, and even without an air of comfort. The
houses are generally small; built of stone, mud, and
brick; and presenting a dull uniformity of appearance.  
  
  
  Clumps of trees and patches of verdure give a rural  
  
  
  F
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 98 -->
aspect to some spots; the margin of the river in
some places is lined with fruit trees, principally the
shadach; but the population appear so poor, and
their habits so filthy, that they neutralize all the
attractions of the inanimate beauties around them.


We were obliged to stop at Heong-shan, the
principal village between Canton and Macao, where our
passes and baggage were examined. Before the
custom-house officers arrived, the water population
crowded round us, and endeavoured, by all the force
of pantomimic argument, to obtain alms from us.


Large pagodas surmounting the tops of some of the
highest hills and others of minor altitude, but
generally upon the principal elevation in the vicinity,
bring forcibly to mind the denounced idolatry of
ancient days. How animating the prospect, that
\"these high places shall be removed," and " the
mountain of the Lord's house shall be established on
the tops of these very mountains ! "


August 27th.—Within the past week we have
visited two of the dwellings of the hong merchants,
situated in the village of Hainam. They are
interesting as specimens ofthe style of living among the
most wealthy classes of the nation. They consist, in
general, of a group of buildings, of different
dimensions and compartments, covering a large area,
adorned with gardens and small lakes or ponds of
water. Around the ponds, and in them, were artificial
rocks, in striking imitation of nature; while the
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 99 -->
beautiful water lily (Nelumbium) spread its broad leaves
above and upon the surface of the waters. With
the exception of a few detached retreats, these
buildings, though they branch off in various
directions, are connected by small enclosed avenues.
The private apartments, accessible only by these
narrow passages, allow of retirement to the family,
and secrecy for scenes of carousal, even when the
more public halls are open for the reception of
strangers. One suite of apartments is fitted up for
the women, another for guests. With one or two
exceptions, the rooms are by no means spacious, but
gaudily, and some of them richly, furnished. The
chairs and tables are large and massive ■ and almost
every room has at least two couches, with a table
between them, designed for a luxurious tete-a-tete.


But the ornamental objects are the most attractive.
Painted and intagliated walls, chandeliers, lamps, a
variety of natural and artificial curiosities and ancient
relics, are displayed to as much advantage as possible.
Some of the specimens of coin and ware are very
ancient; and the large vases, formerly used for idolatrous
purposes, very costly. One of the rooms was fitted
up and furnished as a domestic chapel. Incense was
burnt before a painted figure, intended to represent
the tutelar deity of the house. We have referred to
the custom of putting up tablets in the houses at
the demise of parents, and other near relatives : it is
thought that one of the three spirits, which their  
  
  
  F2
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 100 -->
books assign to each person, abides near this tablet,.
and is refreshed and gratified by the offerings which
are daily made to it.


The proprietor of one of the houses invited us to
the ceremony of burying his mother, which is to take
place during the approaching week. The body has
been preserved above ground for a year, or more; and
now, for the first time since her death, the precise
place and hour of interment have presented
themselves to the imaginations of the deceiving, and
probably deluded, priests*. Our host mentioned that
one ofthe principal hong merchants had a number of
his deceased relatives unburied, some of whom had
been kept thirty years waiting for the lingering
auspicious hour. This is said to be contrary to the
laws of the empire; but superstition has no law,
especially when protected by the strong arm of
pecuniary power. That many, who are guilty of this
offence, have the same controul ofthe law as the one
referred to, is evident from the fact that in January
1830 there were reported to be ten thousand coffined
bodies in Canton not interred *f*.


August 31st, 1830.—Within the past week the
most gaudy pageants and brilliant illuminations have
cheered the darkness of the night. Large boats,

manner. Kindred, friends, and spectators, from all the surrounding

incurred was not less than ten thousand dollars.—Can. Register.

t Canton Register.
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 101 -->
adorned with variegated lamps, have passed the
city in a long line, for a number of successive
evenings*. The lights were arranged in horizontal rows
around the hulls of the vessels, at such distances as to
combine something of the effect of a glowing sheet
of flame with that of innumerable inlaid gems, each
shedding a lustre far more vivid and sparkling than
their rich ground-work. From these rows there were
others branching above in different directions, and
forming different figures. The music, accompanied—
or rather silenced—by the crashing gong, was in
striking contrast with the taste displayed in gratifying
the sense of vision. But such strains, they pretend,
are more grateful to their ears than the finest strains
of European harmony.


Last evening a ceremony was performed before
the factories which combined all the whims of
superstition with some of the sacrificial rites observed
of old by Divine appointment. A large quantity of
tinsel paper, covered with a thin leaf of gold or silver,
was consumed amid rows of lamps and incense-sticks,
to supply the wants of departed spirits. This paper
is cut or formed in imitation of houses, garments,
sedan-chairs, boats, horses, and whatever articles of
necessity or luxury the deceased is imagined to
require. It is supposed to pass by the process of
fire into the world of spirits, and to be there, by some


* These are often hymeneal processions. Whether they ever have
a religious object I was unable to discover.
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 102 -->
unaccountable means, converted into money, and
whatever else is required *. The real wardrobe is
often consumed for the same purpose. Under the
influence of a kindred and equally extravagant
superstition, it is customary for suicides and criminals to
array themselves in their best apparel in the
immediate prospect of death, believing that the spirit
appears in the invisible world with the same
advantages of dress that decked the body at the hour
of separation.


Besides these offerings, a table was spread with
meat, fruit, and wine—no doubt originally intended
for a feast upon a sacrifice, but now perverted to
the gross purpose of feeding the spirits of the
departed f. One of the most respectable servants,
arrayed in his best suit, kneeled before the table,
poured out a libation of wine, and bowed his head to
the ground a number of times; then, taking the
offerings spread before him on the table, he threw a
portion of the fruits to the waiting spectators, and
passed the rest to the servants of the house.


* " The burning of paper (for religious purposes) appears to
have been adopted immediately after the abolition of human
sacrifices, on the death of Che-hwang-te, who died about one hundred
and fifty years before Christ, when he caused his domestics to be
put to death and interred with him, to attend on him in a future
state. At present, the consumption of paper, which is annually
used on all religious occasions, is very considerable, and forms an
extensive branch of trade in China."—Indo-Chinese Gleaner,
vol. ii. p. 36.

-"- When laughed at for their folly, and having the evidence of
more than one of the senses that the offerings remain, they will
often pretend that the flavour, or at least those qualities ofthe food
which nourish the spirit, is extracted.
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 103 -->

For several days service has been performed in
a temporary building at the head of China-Street, by
some priests of the Budh sect. The stage on which
they stood was elevated above the heads of the people,
and was hung around with large paintings. Before
these figures—no doubt intended to represent their
male and female deities—the priests, arrayed in their
pontificals, stood, and, holding a paper in their
hands, mumbled their orisons, in a style that left no
reason to wonder at the striking resemblance,
noticed by the Roman Catholic missionaries, to " the
holy manners " oftheir church. This ceremony is a
grand annual mass for the benefit of those souls that
have no relatives to pray for their release from misery
and transition into happiness. It corresponds, in
many most striking particulars, to the " manners "
referred to, and probably had the same origin.


September 21st.—For several days they have
been preparing some of the principal streets for
a festival in honour of the deity who presides over
fire, and as a thank-offering for preserving the city
from its desolations. He is represented with a
frightful countenance, and a long, flaming beard.
To-night the noise of instruments and voices
announced the commencement of the ceremonies, and
summoned multitudes of spectators to the scene.


The principal street was arched over, from the top
of the houses, with cloth of such a texture as to
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 104 -->
prevent the rain, which was falling at the time, from
interrupting their proceedings. Beneath the
archway were suspended glass chandeliers, variegated
lamps, cloth festoons ofthe most gaudy colours, small
illuminated boats furnished and peopled, with a great
variety of other ornaments, all tastefully arranged,
and glowing with a dazzling brilliance. At each end
of the street a stage was erected, with carved or
painted images in an alcove, and with lighted tapers
and ornamented cakes standing before them.
Musicians were seated on these stages, who accompanied
their noisy instruments with harsh vociferations. To
amuse the crowd, or gratify the gods, or both, men
were engaged in exhibiting feats of manual and
pedestrian dexterity.


September 22d.—The noise of instruments and
voices continued during the greater part of the night.
In extending my walk beyond the limits visited last
evening, I found that a number of streets were
arrayed in the same style as the one described. A
splendid temple had been erected at the intersection
of three of the streets, with a large stage, on which
were displayed a profusion of ornamental and sacred
vases, with pictures, an altar, and tapers. The sides
of this temporary pavilion, above the heads of the
crowd, were composed of several stories, filled with
images representing land and water scenery, and
depicting the martial feats of their heroes, and the
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 105 -->
amusements oftheir gentry. Enclosed within a paling
were large figures, intended probably as
representations of certain species of men and beasts, but which
have no originals in nature. The frightful distortions
of countenance by which the Chinese intend (no
doubt) to express something extremely magnanimous
or superhuman, and especially the flame-coloured
beard, marked out the principal image to be the
object of their present devotions.


The street running parallel with China-Street, in
many respects eclipsed the array of its rival. Through
the whole length of it were suspended, from the
archway above, a great diversity of beautiful cars,
containing male and female figures, decked in robes
of natural flowers. Had it not been for the heavy
odour exhaled from these gay garments, it would
scarcely have been suspected that they were not the
product of delicate and laborious fingers. Even some
of the old residents had always mistaken them for
artificial decorations.


The performance on the stage was continued
throughout the day, and swelled to an almost
deafening clangour towards evening. The crowd became
so dense in tbe street of flowers, that, after toiling
with difficult progress, and descrying in the
perspective nothing but well-stowed heads, I halted for
a short time, and returned. Before leaving this scene
of confusion, I had a fair opportunity of judging of  
  
  
  F 5
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 106 -->
the merits of one of their popular ballad-singers, and
I certainly saw no reason to change the opinion I
had formed of the powers and taste of Chinese
vocalists. Of all grimaces and noises ever seen or
heard, nothing but the wildest buffoonery could equal
this. He stretched his mouth to the utmost tension
of its elastic muscles; raised his voice to its most
unnatural and grating key; and, after a number of
long-drawn shrieks and quavers, exerted it to a pitch
as thrilling as though he felt determined to close
either his own lips or our ears in perpetual silence.
It was necessary to hear the effort, and see the
listening concourse, to believe that such tortured faces
and torturing sounds could ever be endured. Another,
whom I unfortunately encountered yesterday, left
such a stamp of his ludicrous appearance upon my
imagination, as I fear will haunt me for some time to
come.


25th.—This morning, the fifth day from its
commencement, the splendid scene closed. The revel
was kept up all last night; and he who could gaze
upon the living mass which it assembled, especially
after the labourer was released from his daily task,
and not feel the deepest compassion for the ignorance
and infatuation of the nation, must himself be as
truly pitiable as those whom he cannot pity.


An intelligent Chinaman mentioned, that a priest
belonging to the temple of the god whose tutelage
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 107 -->
they thus gratefully acknowledged for the past and
implored for the future, made it his business to go
round every day and take notes of the manner in
which the rites were conducted. At the close of the
ceremonies these are all carefully written on one piece
of paper, and passed into the invisible world, for the
information of the god, "altogether such an one as
themselves."
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 108 -->
  
  CHAPTER V.  
  
  
  CHINA—-CONTINUED.  
  
  
  The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

To give an adequate idea of the various and
complicated miseries existing in China, would be to fill
a volume. Female infanticide, we have reason to
believe, is very common. It is thought, by some of
the best Chinese scholars, to be greatly increased, if
not altogether produced, by their philosophical
notions respecting the origin and continuance of all
things. There are two powers of nature, according
to their books, on the regular action of which the
harmony of the universe, both physical and moral,
depends. Excess or defect in either power, deranges
the system of nature, and introduces disorder in the
affairs of mankind*. One of them they consider to
be of the masculine gender, the other of the feminine;
and the difference between the two, as great asbe
* They believe that originally there was but one eternal
principle, which was merely the first link of a great material chain,
neither distinct from the universe nor endued with any moral
perfections. They represent this first cause, this first link of the
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 109 -->
tween the "vis mobile" and the "vis inertiæ" of
the old philosophers.

• To what extent the inhuman practice of infanticide
prevails in China, we have no means of determining.
In the imperial city, after deducting more than one
half for natural deaths, the number of exposed
infants is, according to Barrow, about four thousand
a year.


Some of the scenes he witnessed while at Pekin
were almost incredible. Before the carts go round
in the morning to pick up the bodies of infants thrown
into the streets—amounting to about four-and-tvventy
every night—dogs and swine are let loose upon them.
The bodies of those found are carried to a common
pit without the city walls, in which the living and
the dead are thrown together. This, however, is a
small proportion, compared with other places.


In some provinces not one in three is suffered to
live; and in others, as the writer has been informed
by the Chinese from those places, the difference
between the male and the female population is as one
to ten. We believe the last statement applies only
to the poorest parts of the empire.

chain, by a circle; but as they feel it difficult to account, from
what they see in nature, for all the absurdities which present
themselves on the supposition of a simple homogeneous body
acting on itself, they suppose, that, when the system of nature
assumed its present-form, the one eternal principle was divided, and
became two powers; which is represented by a figure of a circle
divided in two by a waving line across the centre.—See
IndoChinese Gleaner, vol. iii. page 2.
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 110 -->

\"The most prevalent mode of effecting this crime
is by suffocation; which is done by means of a piece
of paper, dipped in vinegar, laid over the face ofthe
child, so as to prevent it from breathing either by
means of its mouth or nostrils. It is said to be
frequently done to the aged and afflicted, to cut the
brittle thread of life *."


Infanticide is almost exclusively limited to the
female sex; and the condition of that class of the
community, when spared, is an evidence, as well as
a cause, of the real barbarity and misery of the
nation.


A writer on China, after quoting a large portion of
one of their moral works, on the inferiority and
treatment of females, makes the following remarks:
\"The very dependent and degraded state of females
in China may be partly seen from this extract.
They are, moreover, not allowed the confidence of
their husbands, nor to sit at table with them, nor to
have a voice in domestic concerns, nor to visit the
temples, where the prayers of the unfortunate are
supposed to find access. Religion is denied them.
Little attention seems to be paid to the peculiar
circumstances in which, as wives and mothers, they
may be placed. ' Rise; run; work; eat little; spend
little; be silent; keep out of sight; obey; bear; and
rather bleed, starve, and die, than dare to complain,  
  
  
  * Indo-Chinese Gleaner, vol. iii. page 193.
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 111 -->
is the genuine language of the above extract. Though
fortunately for them, humanity, common sense, and
interest, in many cases, plead in their favour, and
procure a relaxation of the rigour of ethical and
legislative restrictions, yet, where such restrictions have
the sanction both of public opinion and of supreme
authority, how is it possible to prevent their hurtful
operation on this tender half of human nature ? * "


Without education, crippled from infancy, closely
immured, married without their consent—in some
instances even sold by their parents—and often
treated most unfeelingly by the relatives and the
other wives of their husbands, we cannot wonder at
the frequent suicides among them, nor at their
attempts to poison those by whom all their happiness
and hopes are spoiled.


The poverty of the lower classes turns to their
account, in the exemption it secures from the
barbarous custom of compressing the feet, and in the
necessity it enjoins of performing laborious work, and
thus escaping the imprisonment to which their
superiors are doomed.


But suffering by the hand of cruelty is not
confined to the female sex in China. In the present
constitution of society, there is scarcely any security
for property or life in the empire. Some of the laws
are unjust; others perverted to the most nefarious
purposes. The innocent are often made to suffer for,  
  
  
  * Indo-Chinese Gleaner.
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 112 -->
and with, the guilty; and the mandarines have it in
their power to dispose of those beneath them
according to their pleasure. Hence the oppression and
extortions under which the nation has long groaned.
Contrary to all the laws of civilized lands, they
consider each as guilty, who might possibly be
involved in the crime committed, until he proves his
innocence. This accounts for that most unreasonable
and most cruel custom of examining by torture. The
innocent are thus frequently confounded with the
guilty; or, if capable of resisting the dreadful
temptation of accusing themselves falsely, are often made
to suffer beyond the demerit of the criminal *.


* " On every occasion they torture by pulling or twisting round
the ears (the torturer having previously rendered his fingers rough
by a powder), and cause the sufferer to kneel a long while upon
chains. They next employ what they call the beauty's bar—(the
breast, small of the back, and legs bent up, are fastened to three
cross bars, which causes the person to kneel in great pain);—the
parrot's beam—(the prisoner is raised from the ground by strings
round the fingers and thumbs, suspended from a supple transverse
beam);—the refiningfuruace—(fire is applied to the body);—and
other implements, expressed by other terms. If these do not force
confession, they double the cruelties; till the criminal faints, and is
restored to life again, several times in a day. Prisoners unable to
sustain these agonies are often compelled to sign a confession of
crimes, of winch, after death, many of them are proved guiltless.
The cruelties exercised by the local magistrates cannot be described;
and the various police runners are equally ingenious in forming plans
to enrich themselves. In criminal cases (as murder and robbery), in
debts, and affrays, they endeavour to involve all who appear to have
the slightest connexion with the matter, that they may obtain bribes
from them for the purchase of their liberty. These petty officers
load their captives with fetters, until they cannot stir an inch, and
release them only on receiving a large sum. Their sufferings are
daily accumulated, until death is the consequence."—Indo-Chinese
Gleaner, vol. i.
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 113 -->

Their modes of punishment, when guilt is proved,
and especially in criminal cases, are often shocking
in the extreme. Strangling and beheading are so
common that scarcely any notice is taken of them.
\"More than a thousand criminals suffer death
annually in the province of Canton. A learned
Chinese says that a hundred, on an average, are put
to death by law in the province every month."


"In the close of 1816 there were, in the various
prisons of the Chinese empire, ten thousand two
hundred and seventy criminals convicted of capital
offences, and awaiting the imperial order to carry into
effect the sentence of death. Some men, from their
sufferings in prison—which is generally so loathsome
and horrible a place that it is called " hell"—cannot
support themselves in the position required. At night
they are chained to inclined boards, on which they
sleep. Cleanliness is neglected; and their dungeons
become offensive and unhealthful in the highest
degree. Money can procure some alleviation; and the
prisoners of long standing attack in the most ferocious
manner those unhappy persons who have newly
entered. They seize them by their arms and legs, toss
them, beat them, and bite them, to extort money from
them*'." The most heinous offences are visited with
inflictions of the most refined and exquisite cruelty.
Crucifixion, cutting to pieces, and every species of
slow and painful execution, is employed.

  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  CHINA—CONTINUED.

From the last date to the time of his departure, the
journal ofthe writer is principally filled with details
of the religious services of his fellow-missionary and
himself, among the residents at Canton and the
seamen at Whampoa. As Mr. Bridgman uniformly took
part in all the public duties ofthe Sabbath, we were
enabled to supply both places with very little
interruption *. A transcript has been published by the
American Seamen's Society.


It may not be out of place here to repeat, that his
object was to ascertain the practicability of having a
seamen's chaplain stationed at this important mart of
commerce, and that the short experiment fully
sanctioned the benevolent plan. During this limited
period, many facts of no ordinary interest occurred,


* Besides the study of the language, which necessarily occupies
much of Mr. B.'s time, he has about half a dozen promising
Chinese lads under his instruction, who have been submitted by their
parents to his entire controul, and dwell in the factory with him.
One of them is the son of Leang Asa. Let those interested in the
conversion of China pray that these youths may become Christians,
and teachers of their countrymen.
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 115 -->
which proclaimed the necessity of carrying on the
work commenced, and the readiness of a merciful
Saviour to bless the endeavour.


It is affecting to consider what multitudes, who
leave their homes in health and hope, find a grave
upon these heathen shores. Numbers every season
are buried from the shipping; and some ofthe most
promising in health, and prosperous in their calling,
have been this year unexpectedly summoned to their
last account. It was delightful to find many, of
different nations, mingling in the worship of the
\"same Lord over all," and so favourably impressed
with the value of spiritual blessings, as to request
that their respective ships might be made the
temporary chapel.


The only thing necessary to make the station one
of the most important in foreign lands, is a
permanent and commodious place of worship, where all
may have the opportunity of attending, and which
may afford the chaplain every advantage in pursuing
his labours.


In addition to the claims of the maritime
community, it may be mentioned that there is a small
population in Canton, who, for more than half the
year, have no religious services. Gain being their
paramount object, and having little or nothing to
remind them oftheir religious interests, it may readily
be supposed that such will not prove the most
favourable representatives of the Christian world, and that
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 116 -->
the heathen will be but ill prepared by " their good
works which they shall behold, to glorify God in the
day of visitation."


Besides the regular morning worship, a service
was established in the evening of the Lord's-day, at
which a large and attentive congregation were
generally present.


But the subject of the greatest interest, connected
with this scene of exertion, is the conversion of China
unto Him from whom she has revolted. Here is an
object, indeed, whose magnitude beggars description;—
the salvation ofa whole empire—the most important
empire upon earth—itself more extensive than all
Europe, and containing, at least, one-third of earth's
entire population! Look where we may, beneath the
the wide expanse of the heavens, we can find no
distinct enterprize so laudable, so imperious, so
inconceivable in its results, as the conversion of
China.


The real condition of her hundreds of millions is
but little understood *. With all her empty boast of
perfection, and the vapid eulogiums of her ignorant
panegyrists, there is probably no other space upon
earth so filled with real wretchedness as China. Her
\"mild patriarchal government," is a system of
injustice and oppression. From the " Dragon throne,"
tothe lowest menial in authority, self-aggrandizement


* The most authentic census, taken in 1812, gave a population
of upwards of three hundred and sixty millions,
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 117 -->
is the reigning passion; extortion and cruelty the
means of its gratification. Her plebeian happiness
is the combined result of poverty, virtual slavery, and
vice. Those who have had the best opportunities
of judging, give the most painful description of the
indigence and depravity of the populace. The
middling class, or those who enjoy a competence, are few
in number; and they too are often treated without
justice or mercy, and, if possessed of power, are quite
as unjust and merciless. Even the appearance of
happiness which captivates the stranger must be
mere shew; for, consisting, as it does, in earthly
possessions, there is very little in the laws, or their
corrupt administration, to give it basis or perpetuity.


It is true that their literature is extensive : but how
far it is calculated to elevate their character or to
meliorate their condition, may be determined by the
fact that scarcely a subject of which they treat is
understood, while the most important truths, the
only ones which can improve the moral character of
man, are totally unknown *


Thus the conversion of China, with all the
blessings attendant upon Christianity, becomes an object
of worldly philanthropy, as well as of Christian
benevolence. None, whose heart is not as hard as


* Their philosophy, history, poetry, are so mixed up with the
marvellous and absurd, that, with the exception ofthe maxims of
their sages, some of which are excellent, there is nothing worth
exploring in the whole field of their science.
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 118 -->
adamant, can gaze upon this scene of distress without
emotion.


But how infinitely vast—how worthy of all
sacrifice, all hazard, all experiment — does the moral
elevation of this nation appear, when viewed in its
connexion with the Redeemer's glory! Here is a
triumph and a trophy for His victorious grace; a gem
as pure and as bright as earth can offer, to deck His
mediatorial crown! With the eye of this gracious
Being upon us, and His heart upon the salvation of
those who have been promised Him as His
inheritance, what can express our gratitude, evince our
discipleship, or display our allegiance and love, if
the conversion of China be not the object of our
prayers, and plans, and utmost endeavours 1


For the present accomplishment of this
undertaking, very much may be done.  
  
  
  "Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees;  
  
  
  Relies on that alone;
Laughs at impossibilities,  
  
  
  And says, It shall be done.''

Missionaries should be sent forth to every accessible
place in the empire, and to every mart of her
commerce in the surrounding seas. The coasts should
be invaded, and the seaports entered; as they have
been, and still are, by the undaunted genius of
commerce. Every opening should be searched out, every
tenable post occupied, every lawful engagement
subordinated, every passport possessed. Others have
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 119 -->
entered, and gained their respective objects. Pagans,
Jews, Mahommedans, Papists, nominal Protestants
—all have penetrated, but those who were alone
capable of benefiting the nation, and alone commanded
to hazard their lives in the attempt *.


The Chinese are extremely inquisitive, patient in
research, fond of literature, free from the shackles of
caste, and comparatively but little wedded to their
systems of religion. These qualities, added to the
fact that the Bible and some scores of excellent works
have been translated and written in their own
character, afford the greatest encouragement to pray with
expectation, and labour with confidence, for their
spiritual welfare.  
  
  
  But alas! if there were highways opened through


* The interesting voyages of Mr. Gutzlaff along the coast of
China, made after the writer had left Canton, have brought to light
a number of most important facts, and placed China in an aspect
in which Christians never beheld her before. They have shewn that,
contrary to received opinion, the natives are fond of intercourse
with foreigners—that no barriers need prevent this intercourse—that
the Chinese have a high opinion of our medical skill—and that they
receive Christian books with the utmost avidity. These voyages,
together with previous information,lead us to suppose that there are
four direct ways of influencing China: occupying the ports of
commerce in the empire, accessible to all; sending ships along the coasts,
freighted with Christian publications; establishing mission stations
where the vessels touch, in the maritime cities and the adjacent
islands; and having the marts to which the Chinese trade, in the
neighbouring kingdoms and islands, well supplied with missionaries
and pious physicians. In the last-mentioned stations, experiment
has proved that the missionary becomes known, both to those
whom he meets abroad and to their friends at home; his
disinterested, unpolitical object is proved and approved; and his way is
thus prepared to " enter in and dwell among them."
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 120 -->
every part ofthe empire, there are none "shod with
the preparation of the Gospel of peace " to travel upon
them. The few missionaries sent by all Christendom
to China, are by no means equal to the duties of
their own stations. Those who have not been toiling
sotyears at the language, are not qualified for such an
undertaking; and the Christian world appears still to
slumber over the claims and calls of these perishing
millions. Even admitting all that has been imagined
—that the empire is barred and sealed against
foreigners—still there is preparatory work enough for
hosts of labourers, and work which must be done,
though the Emperor and every subject in his realm
should unite their voices in imploring our aid.


The language is to be acquired, before any thing
can be attempted; and they who can give the
greatest number of years to its acquisition, are the best
prepared to employ it to advantage : and they may
employ it to advantage even now. As the Chinese are
a reading and reflecting people, it appears
exceedingly important that they should be made acquainted
with many of those branches of general literature
which are the most useful. Of the history of other
nations, and the geography of other countries, most
of the nation are grossly ignorant. China, according
to their ideas, is the centre, and well nigh the sum,
of the world; the focus of all intellectual and moral
light; not only the glory of the earth, but the
counterpart of heaven. It is scarcely necessary to say,
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 121 -->
that the tendency of such sentiments is fatal to the
introduction of every external influence; and that,
until correct information be communicated, this
haughty contempt of foreign attainments and customs
will probably continue, at least among the learned.
If works on all important subjects were sent forth, in
every possible form, through the empire, the good
effected would, in all probability, be incalculable.
Here, then, is a work which can scarcely be
completed before, according to the dullest faith, there
must be a change favourable to the introduction and
propagation of Christianity in these regions.


So that, on any supposition, missionaries ought to
be on the ground; qualifying themselves for labour,
and preparing the means by which they are to labour;
availing themselves of all the facilities which exist,
and watching every providential opening which may
be presented.

  CHAPTER VII.  
  
  
  PASSAGE TO JAVA.

Having received an invitation from Capt.
Drummond, to accompany him, in the H. C. ship Castle
Huntley, to Java, where he understood I was going,
we left Canton at midnight of December 28th, and
proceeded in a large " chop boat" to the ship, lying
below the second bar. The Castle Huntley, though
rather inferior in dimensions to some of the vessels
in the same service, exceeds thirteen hundred tons
in burden, carries twenty-six guns, and has a crew of
one hundred and forty men. Every ship of this kind
affords scope for the most zealous chaplain; and if,
as in the present instance, favoured with the advice,
the co-operation, and the prayers of the commander,
the prospect of success is highly animating. We
had Divine service every Sabbath morning, when the
weather admitted, on deck, and every evening in the
cuddy. A part of almost each day was spent on the
gun-deck, among the crew, visiting the sick,
instructing the ignorant, and exhorting all " to repent and
believe."  
  
  
  Having never before been brought into such
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 123 -->
conslant contact with a large number of sailors, I had an
excellent opportunity of testing and correcting my
previous opinions respecting the best mode of
profitable intercourse with them on board ship.


A sailor, as all the world knows, is a strange being.
Bluntness is one characteristic, and bluntness,mingled
with an earnest seriousness, must be employed to
meet it. No time need be spent in any conversation
preliminary to the subject of personal religion. It
generally leads to such remarks or complaints from
them as tend to defeat the object, rather than to
promote it.


Disrespect, where there is no restraint upon them,
and frequently a shocking oath, or a loud avowal of
their contempt of your presence and purpose, are at
first employed, by a few of the more hardy spirits,
to shew to their shipmates their manly superiority to
religious scruples, and probably to prevent you from
intruding into their retirement, or disturbing their
consciences. This, however, is seldom repeated, if
the case be properly managed at the time. Let
them see that you are dauntless; that all such
obstacles, instead of subduing, only animate you;
instead of irritating, only soften your spirit into the
deeper compassion; that you regard their salvation
as of infinite importance, and could weep at the
enormity oftheir crimes, and the imminence of their
danger, and you will generally find these bravadoes
in future among the most deferential and docile.  
  
  
  G2
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 124 -->
If the challenge or oath is as evidently intended for
your ears as for their companions, " rebuke them
before all," shewing, at the same time, that you have
no wish to retaliate, or simply to put them to shame,
but to expose the exceeding guilt and madness of
such unprovoked rebellion against God.


If you can make a sailor feel that his usual
wickedness and indifference to duty can proceed from
nothing but ignorance, as wilful as it is profound, and
that you have no secular object in view in exhorting
or instructing him, you have obtained a claim upon
his ear, and a passport to bis heart. When these
first difficulties, which are the most appalling to
those unaccustomed to exertion among seamen, are
mastered, the peculiarities of each case must, as on
shore, indicate its treatment.


Probably no unvarying plan of systematic effort
on board ship, can be adopted. This must depend
upon the dispositions of the officers, the regulations
of the vessel, and, in a measure, the inclinations of
the men. Opportunities for private conversation may
always be found, and tracts and small practical
works may be distributed, under almost all
circumstances.


For the greatest benefit to this class of men we
must look to those who labour among them in port.
As a sailor has no circumspection, no forecast, others
should exercise these qualities for him. The crimps
have long availed themselves of these characteristic
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 125 -->
defects, and the consequences are too well known to
be detailed. The boarding systems at home should
be broken up—of course by means of counteracting
exertions. There must be such a desperate invasion
upon the usurped province of every crimp, as to
leave him no means of subsistence unless he abandon
his inhuman traffic in the souls and bodies of his
victims.


The immense good which may, and must, result
from the conversion of this class of men, is best
appreciated by those who have resided in foreign
lands. Sailors generally prove a most serious
detriment to all missionary efforts; and should they
become subjects of religion themselves, instead of
\"scattering firebrands, arrows, and death," upon
every heathen shore where they touch, they would
help to sow " the seed of eternal life," even where
missionaries have never travelled.


Among the crew was a young man from
NewYork, whom the captain pointed out as quite
superior in intellect to his shipmates, but who, on
account of the most glaring misconduct, had been
publicly flogged. I had frequent opportunities of
conversing with him, and found him in a frame of
mind which appeared favourable to religious
impressions. He was willing to accompany me in any
capacity, but I did not feel myself at liberty to take
him, neither should I have deemed the step prudent
under any circumstances, with the uncertain
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 126 -->
prospect before me. The custom of sending boys of
respectability to sea, or of allowing them to follow
their own roving dispositions and make a trial of
this mode of life, is common both in Great Britain
and America.


Having heard the opinions of many, of different
nations, and in all the capacities of the merchant
service, the writer feels the more anxious to echo in
the ears of the young and uninitiated the voice of
experience on this subject. Though this topic has
been one of frequent conversation, he has met with
none, accustomed to good society, who, if they were
compelled to continue this life, did not deplore the
necessity which bound them to it, and dissuade
their children and others from entering upon it as a
matter of choice.


If the acquisition of wealth, or a simple livelihood,
be the object, probably none of the ordinary pursuits
of life could prove less advantageous. The wages,
if not inadequate to current expenses, are most
scantily proportioned to them; and even with the
prospect ofa speedy advancement, which few enjoy,
and still fewer realize, the result is the same. The
highest station affords a bare subsistence to a man
who has a family to support, and the liberty of a
limited trade, which is granted to him, generally adds
but very little to his income. To this must be added
the necessity of being absent from his family more
than three-fourths of his time, deprived of the
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 127 -->
comforts and privileges of shore, and exposed to daily
trials, of which landsmen have no conception.


The fact that so few captains of ships amass
fortunes, and the still more embarrassing truth, to which
allusion has been made, that scarcely any continue
this line of life from choice, are sufficient to controul
the judgments of all who are selecting their worldly
occupations, and have the advantages of the wide
continent of America before them.


Sometimes a seaman's berth has been selected for
a voyage or two, to improve the morals of the
dissipated. Those who are lawless on land, are sent to
sea for salutary discipline; but here again, no plan
could be more subversive of its end. The mixed
society, composed of the lowest class of men, gathered
from different nations, and trained to different habits;
the want of religion, so prevalent among seamen; the
unrestrained licentiousness of the mass; the
triumphant detail of disgraceful conduct on shore, embellished
by their own wit, and set off by the most pithy
vulgarisms and blasphemies they have ever heard,
usually prove as fatal to every correct moral
sentiment, as do the tar and grease and dirt—the element
of the forecastle—to all ideas of refinement and
delicacy.


It is pleasing to know that there are exceptions
to the general rule. Wealth and piety have been
acquired at sea, and the latter is occasionally found
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 128 -->
among sailors; but, alas! the want of each is too
common to encourage the hazardous experiment.


A few days after leaving China we made the coast
of Cochin-China, and saw, as its most prominent
object, something in appearance like a pagoda,
towering on the summit of a high hill. The distance
was too great to define the object, but we have since
learned that it is a rock thus curiously formed.


Cochin-China is a kingdom of considerable
importance. Including Tonquin and part of Cambojia,
which are now annexed to it, it covers a large extent
of country, and contains a hardy, energetic
population. The Chinese language is well understood by
the inhabitants of Annam—the native appellation of
this country;—although they employ another
character in common intercourse, which bears affinity to the
ancient Chinese, or Seal character. The Roman
Catholics have long had a footing in this kingdom.
They reckon about three thousand converts, the great
majority being in Tonquin. Formerly they were high
in favour at court, but upon the death of the king,
whom the Bishop of Adran brought over to France
for education, their influence diminished, and recently
they have suffered severe persecution. Those who
have visited Cochin-China for trade, give no
favourable account of the honesty or liberality of the
natives. They are represented as rather cruel and
intolerant, disposed to take advantage of strangers,
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 129 -->
and unfriendly to the admittance and residence of
foreigners among them. How far the latter may be
the policy of the Government, as in China, we can
only conjecture; but that many of those traits of
character which render them peculiarly offensive to
Protestant strangers, are produced, or at least
strengthened, by the intolerant spirit of Catholicism,
there is strong reason to believe. The nation may be
influenced and approached throughSiam or Cambojia,
or it might be benefited by more direct means. The
possibility of the latter can be ascertained only by
the visit of a trading ship.


We spent two days, in procuring water and fuel,
on the coast of Sumatra. During this time the
passengers and officers amused themselves on shore,
in walking, shooting, picking shells, 8cc. With the
exception ofa few temporary huts, without
inhabitants, there was not a human vestige to be seen.
Traces of elephants and deer, with an abundance of
snipe and quails, proclaimed the wildness of the
region; while swarms of most voracious and adhesive
insects furnished a sufficient reason for the absence
of man. It was rather remarkable, that though
nothing which indicated the presence of human
beings could be discovered, yet the last boat had
scarcely put off from the shore before smoke began
to ascend, and fires to glow, in the very place we
had left. The next morning we were visited by  
  
  
  g 5
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 130 -->
two or three small canoes, manned by half-naked,
puny natives, bringing a few fowls to sell or barter.


A few hours after leaving Sumatra, the ship was
again riding at anchor, abreast of Angier. As soon
as she was descried, boats were sent from the neigh
bouring islands, with poultry, yams, fruit, birds,
monkeys, &c, all in great abundance, and at the
most reduced prices.


The most striking peculiarity of the natives, is
the artificial shape and colour of their teeth. They
conceive it a mark of beauty, some say of distinction
from the brute creation, to pass a file horizontally
over the centre of the front teeth, giving them the
form of a crescent, and then to stain them with a
vegetable preparation, which often renders them as
black as jet. The appearance is rather disgusting to
a stranger, and the disagreeable effect is not
diminished by the general custom, among both sexes,
of cramming their mouths with betel, cere, and
tobacco, the latter of which is allowed to protrude
beyond the lips. This mixture, as might be
supposed, produces an action of the salivary glands, and
it. is soon evident that they are regardless of the
delicacy of all who may be near them.
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 131 -->
  
  CHAPTER VIII.  
  
  
  JAVA.

Angier is the point of Java where ships in the
favourable monsoons pass, and generally call for
supplies of water and provisions. It is situated on a
large plain, adorned with extensive groves of
cocoanut trees, and flanked by an amphitheatre of the most
diversified and picturesque hills. The luxuriance of
the verdure mantling every part of the plain, and
decking the sloping sides and the summits of the
highlands with a charming variety of lofty forests
and spreading fields, produces the most favourable
impression of the fertility and beauty for which the
island is famed *. A small fort, a bungalow or two,
and a native village, stand in close vicinity near the
shore. As there is no hotel in the place, I went
immediately to the residence of one of the Dutch
gentlemen to whom I had letters, and who received
me with much kindness.


Supposing that I was anxious to proceed to
Batavia without delay, and being unable to provide


* I saw it twice—once during the rainy season, afterwards in fine
weather—and it scarcely appeared like the same place.
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 132 -->
a carriage immediately, arrangements were made for
my being transported on the shoulders ofthe natives
for the first twenty miles. The idea of being carried
such a distance, in a confined chair, over bad roads,
and through almost incessant showers, would not
have been agreeable, even had I known the native
language, been familiar with the way, and acquainted
with the persons on whose hospitality I was obliged
to trespass for my night's lodging. As my kind
host had made every preparation, under the evident
impression that I could not delay, and there appeared
no alternative to a speedy departure without
violating all the rules of politeness, I was on the
point of taking my seat in the vehicle, which, from
its structure, must have required a recumbent
position, when the crack of a whip and the rattling
of wheels announced the approach of a more
comfortable conveyance. It proved to be a Government
coach, which was hired by travellers, and which
would be ready the next day to convey me to Batavia.
I felt thankful for this seasonable relief. Many such
incidents I could record, which, scattered through
the course of my life, connect the hours of earliest
remembrance with the present moment, and which I
hope never to forget.


January 20, Batavia.—As the arrangements were
not made so soon as at first expected, I remained
at Angier until yesterday morning. About seven A.M.
we started, with the intention of proceeding forty
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 133 -->
miles, being half the distance, and leaving the rest of
the journey for the following day. We started, as is
customary in Java, at full gallop; changed horses
every six miles; and, notwithstanding such a state of
the roads as fixed us in the mud two or three times,
accomplished the day's journey by about two p.m.


The face of the country was considerably varied
with hill and dale, wildness and cultivation. All the
low and level tracts of land were devoted to the
culture of rice, and some of these fields extended as far
as the eye could reach. In almost every part of the
way the natives of both sexes were laboriously
engaged, tilling the land with buffaloes, and
transplanting the young grain from its original bed. Such had
been the abundance of rain since the wet season
commenced, that all the low grounds were
submerged, and the labourer was obliged to wade, often
to an inconvenient depth, in fulfilling his task.


We passed a number of villages, situated on the
elevated ridges of land, and, as far as could be
discovered (for they are generally concealed in clusters
of trees), consisting of a group of miserable huts,
scarcely sufficient to shelter their occupants from the
rain, protect them from beasts of prey, or contain
their necessary supply of provisions. At intervals
along the road, sheds were erected for
marketplaces, where the natives assemble to traffic. In one
of them about two or three thousand were collected.
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 134 -->
What a congregation for the Christian Teacher!
Indeed every thing indicated a dense population, and
seemed to invite the missionary to come and be the
instrument of raising them from their mental and
spiritual degradation.


The house at which I stopped stands some distance
from the main road, on an estate of more than sixty
square miles, and in the vicinity of furious beasts and
elegant birds. Tigers of the most dangerous
description infest the country, and even carry away the
natives, while the woods are enlivened by flocks of
majestic and beautiful peacocks. The manager ofthe
estate received and entertained me with much
hospitality. The principal object of curiosity which I
saw in accompanying him over part of the estate, was
a large petrified tree, imbedded in a few feet of soil.


About seven this morning we left the estate, and
continued our journey. The country now began to
assume an aspect of more civilization, which increased
as we approached Batavia, and,except the deficiency
of comfortable dwellings, reminded me forcibly of
familiar objects at home.


At the entrance to Batavia was a group of houses
extending some distance along the road, and occupied
by Chinamen. They were all surrounded with water;
many' of them flooded so as to be uninhabitable;
while the people were obliged to move about in boats,
or splash along at a depth which admitted of but a
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 135 -->
slow progress. This spot proved to be below the
general level of the country, and we were happy, after
riding some distance at a most tardy pace, to emerge
from the flood and pursue our way on dry land. The
horses were urged forward at their usual speed,
through streets consisting of Chinese houses, with a
canal of running water on one side, until we left the
precincts of the old town for that part of the city
occupied by Europeans. The canal still bordered
the way, while handsome residences, with courts in
front, lined the opposite side. One of these proved
to be the hotel, at which the carriage stopped about
three p. m.


As the day was not sufficiently advanced to admit
of the remainder being wasted, I procured a
conveyance, and called on Mr. Medhurst, the English
missionary, by whom I was received with the
cordiality and kindness of a brother in Christ. To avoid
the malaria and heat of the town, the residents have
built their dwellings upon a large plain, which
extends some distance into the interior, and is
intersected by the finest roads.


January 24.—Yesterday (Sabbath) I attended
three services in the mission chapel—two in English
and one in Malay. Mr. M. is in the habit of having
another service, for those who speak the native
language, in the town, and frequently in one of the
prisons; so that the day is filled up with active
exertions. He is assisted by Mr. William Young, a
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 136 -->
young man who is capable of conducting the
service in Malay, understands Chinese tolerably well,
and whose abilities and zeal in his Master's service
render him a valuable acquisition to the mission.
There is another young person connected with the
mission, a native Amboynese, who appears to have
been truly converted to God within the last year.


Java is well known, as one of the most important
colonial possessions attached to any European crown.
More than two centuries have passed away since the
Dutch became masters of some of its best districts;
and during all this time it has been in the hands of
nations professing Protestantism. Like the other
possessions of the Dutch, it has received its share of
chaplains; but, compared with the active zeal
displayed in enlightening the natives of some of the
other islands, scarcely any attempts appear to have
been made for the conversion of Java.


\"This island," writes one who resides there, and
who has long had the best opportunities of obtaining
the most correct information, "contains a population
of six millions, four of whom speak the Javanese
language, one and a half the Sunda, and half a
million the Malayan. Its three principal towns are
Batavia, Samarang, and Soerabaya. Batavia contains,
within a circuit of twenty miles, three hundred
thousand souls, of whom thirty thousand are Chinese;
Samarang has about two hundred thousand natives
and ten thousand Chinese; and Soerabaya about
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 137 -->
three hundred thousand natives and five thousand
Chinese. There are, besides, about ten thousand
Chinese scattered about in various parts of the island.
These three principal towns are frequently visited by
strangers, and no foreigners, who have not excited
the displeasure of Government, have been refused
permission to reside in them.


\"The Dutch systematically avoid establishing
missions among Mahommedans, and endeavour to
thrust their missionaries away, into bye places, as
much as possible. Hence on the whole island of
Java, entirely under their own dominion, they have
not a single missionary. Formerly two missionaries
were stationed at Christian villages, but with the
exclusive object of ministering to those who already
professed Christianity. These are both dead *.


\"The two missionaries on the island are stationed
at Batavia and Soerabaya. The first has been allowed
to become a burgher, which entitles him to the right
of residence, the permanent tenure of property, and
the liberty of travelling through any part of the colony.
He has never experienced the least hindrance from
Government, in the prosecution of his work. The


* " It may here be observed, that the missionaries formerly sent
out by the Dutch Society were illiterate men, which, added to the
general prejudice against missionary efforts, tended to bring their
office into contempt. Since then, the character and qualifications
of their missionaries have greatly improved, but the prejudice
still continues strong against them, and it seems indigenous to a
Dutchman's mind to consider a missionary as vastly inferior to a
settled minister."
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 138 -->
other missionary has not been so much favoured :
the authorities interfered in the midst of a most
interesting work, and his Testaments and tracts,
which the eager natives flocked in thousands to
receive, were all seized. At Soerabaya some good
people have formed themselves into an auxiliary
missionary society, established a school for heathen
children, and exerted themselves in preparing and
distributing tracts among the natives. They have done
much, and would effect more if a missionary resided
among them.


\"There is an opening for missionaries at Batavia,
Samarang, and Soerabaya. Every facility would be
afforded by their brethren in two of these settlements:
assistance in the native languages, books, residence,
and advice, would be most freely given."


The New Testament, and other books, have been
translated into the Javanese, which, with the
numerous Christian works printed in the Malay and
Chinese languages, afford the greatest advantages
for effecting immediate good.


The writer having accepted the kind invitation of
Mr. and Mrs. Medhurst to take up his residence
with them, employed his time principally in
accompanying the missionary in his daily labours among the
heathen, and in studying the dialect of the Chinese
language most current in this settlement. A journal
of events, kept at the time, has already been
published. A few extracts will give the reader an idea
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 139 -->
of the nature of the field, and the necessity of aid in
its cultivation.


January 26th.—Spent part of this morning among
the Chinese residences in the town. Mr. M. generally
devotes a portion of every day to visiting the natives
and Chinese, for the purpose of conversing and
distributing tracts. In every house where there appears
to be a probability of engaging the occupants in
conversation, he enters, sometimes by invitation,
generally " sans ceremonie."


The Chinese sense of politeness is always such as
to secure him a reception sufficient for his purpose.
To the dwellings of the Malays there is not the same
liberty of access. The Chinese frequently listen with
apparent interest, and receive the tracts readily.


February 4th.—In our usual rounds to-day we
visited a hospital, where the leprous, blind, and
deranged, are kept. Of the former class were some of
the most miserable objects I ever beheld. Unable to
leave their couch, with limbs partially consumed,
withered, and covered with a loathsome ulceration,
they were peculiarly calculated to impress the mind
with a sense of the more deplorable, and by human
means equally incurable, malady of the heart, of
which this dreadful infliction is an emblem, and was
a punishment. " Who maketh thee to differ from
another ? "


One of them mentioned to Mr. Medhurst that he
believed his disease was the punishment of sin in a
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 140 -->
former life, according to their notions of the
metempsychosis; and, when referred to the demerit of
guilt in the present existence, as a more plausible,
and an adequate reason, pointed most significantly
in reply to a youth of but twelve years of age, who
was a much greater sufferer, and on this supposition
a less guilty sinner than himself. Among the blind
was a youth, who could not imagine why he
should be thus severely visited, since he had once
saved the life of a fellow-being, at the hazard of his
own. Self-righteousness, and as its consequence a
disposition to murmur against the afflictive
dispensations of Providence, are, alas ! too prevalent in every
country.


Mr. Medhurst frequently avails himself of the
moral precepts of their sages, as an admitted rule of
conduct; and then, upon their confessions of guilt,
declares the only way in which God can be just and
the sinner justified.


February 6th.—We have just returned from an
interesting visit to one of the bazaars, where about
two or three thousand natives and Chinese were
collected. The latter compose the great majority of
tradesmen in Batavia, being more ingenious, active,
shrewd, and gain-seeking, than the natives. Wherever
money is to be made, by dint or traffic, manufacture,
gambling or gulling, Chinamen are sure to be found.
Acquainted, from long experience, with the best mode
of gaining his object, Mr. M. went directly to a
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 141 -->
part of the market where the men resort, after their
most important business is finished, to purchase as
much tobacco as they require before the next
marketday. The anxieties of trade have so far subsided
before they reach this place, as to render it much less
difficult to secure their attention to an object which
yields no immediate palpable advantage. His success
in gaining their ear, and in awakening a desire to
obtain books, was truly animating. In a very short time
his budget of tracts, many of them of a large size—as
the Gospel of Matthew—had entirely disappeared.


Tbe surprising change evinced in the disposition of
the natives within the last year is remarkable, and
very encouraging. Until thus recently he was
generally obliged to return with the number of his
books undiminished. He scarcely succeeded in
distributing a dozen copies in as many months, on
account of the influence of their Mahommedan priests
and rulers, and the dread they inspired. Since the
commencement of this happy, and, as far as visible
means are concerned, unaccountable change in the
minds ofthe people, hundreds have been distributed
without the least difficulty.


Another fact, full of promise, connected with the
reception of these books, is the eagerness ofthe natives
to understand their contents, and the means they often
employ to obtain this knowledge. It is said that
those who are unacquainted with letters will go
through their villages to have the books read, and
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 142 -->
that, rather than remain ignorant of their truths,
they will carry them to the chief men, and even to
the priests themselves. Mr. M. says that these very
rulers and priests, who were formerly so distant and
ill-disposed towards him and his poison, have
condescended to come and solicit Christian books for their
own perusal. Yet nothing beyond the simple
disposition to receive and read these books has thus far
appeared : the valley remains in deathful silence,
and the bones are very dry; but the prophet has
entered; " Thus saith the Lord God " begins to be
heard, and we look and pray for the breath of
Jehovah to come and breathe upon the slain *.


14th.—Yesterday (Sabbath), besides the ordinary
English and Malay services in the mission chapel, we
visited a large prison, containing about three hundred
native convicts. The missionary, or one of the young
men who assist him, holds service bere every Sabbath.
It was a subject of considerable anxiety to the
prisoners, chiefly Mahommedans, at the commencement
of these religious exercises, to ascertain the precise
object of the preacher. Some imagined that the
redemption to which he referred was deliverance from
chains and imprisonment: others were filled with
apprehension, and fancied, from his statements of the
evil and demerit of sin, that they were forthwith to
be sold as slaves, and transported to some distant
country.  
  
  
  * Ezekiel xxxvii. 1—10.
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 143 -->

They all (except a few) assembled beneath a cluster
of large shady trees, and remained in a sitting posture
until the service was closed. The countenances of
many of them disclosed an interest in the subject
which could not fail to animate the speaker. One
of the prisoners, who died a short time since, gave
pleasing evidence of the benefit of these instructions,
and confided his departing spirit into the hands of
the Saviour, of whom he had heard in this place of
confinement. Thus the very prison may become the
gate of heaven, and the fetters of the guilty the
appointed instrument to keep them back from
destruction, and " compel them to come in."


17th.—For nearly a week the Chinese have been
enjoying their greatest holiday. It is with them
the season of new year; work is generally
suspended; their best robes are displayed; children are
loaded with costly ornaments, and carried in
complimentary form from house to house; while the best
wishes for temporal prosperity—a long purse and
life—are interchanged. The tables groan beneath
their luxurious burdens; the gods are supplied with
every variety of eatables, and their faces are tinged
with the smoke of tapers and incense. Every one
yields himself up to pleasure; and gambling, the
delight of the nation, groups its votaries " in the
house and by the way-side."  
  
  
  When we enter their dwellings, tea is generally
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 144 -->
handed round in small cups, and the pipe is seldom
used until it has been offered to the visitor.


Here, as at Canton, the most common figure
before which they offer their sacrifices is the
representative of an ancient deified hero, called in the
Mandarin dialect Kwanfootze. He has been adopted by
the reigning Tartar family as their patron deity. An
imperial proclamation was issued, commanding the
homage of the whole empire to this pretended god
of war. In every painting he appears as an
exceedingly gross, ill-favoured being, with an idiotical
formation of head, small lengthened eyes running up the
forehead, ears almost on a line with the top of the
head, a forehead not unlike the upper part ofa cone,
and cheeks and chin resembling its extended base.
To this is added a long spare beard, which he is
represented stroking in calm reflection with his right
hand.


Behind his chair stands a black figure, said to
represent an adjutant, holding a huge weapon in
one hand, with a countenance of deadly rage, his
eyes bursting from their swollen sockets, and in a
stooping posture, as if communicating the most
exasperating intelligence to the unruffled warrior.


The former, though the most common, is by no
means the only image used for religious purposes.
A celebrated Esculapius, of whose surgical and
magical powers the most fabulous legends are preserved
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 145 -->
and credited, often occupies the place appointed for
the deity on the wall opposite the door of entrance,
and receives the adoration of the household. He is
painted in the act of conjuring an invisible being,
with his face towards the heavens and a small wand
in his outstretched hand, while a hideous figure,
answering to their idea of the dragon—which they
imagine to be the chief agent in the kingdom of
Providence—answers to the summons, and appears in the
clouds. Other representations are often preferred;
not unfrequently the form of a female, and, by some,
merely the Chinese character for spirit, happiness,
long life, wealth, &c. Small images placed before
these paintings are also common.


21st.—In our rounds to-day we met a Chinaman
from the province of Teo-chew, or Tay-chew, who
related some of the horrid cruelties practised upon
the female infants of the common people. He says
the custom of infanticide is almost universal among
this class of the community. If the parent supposes
that the marriage portion received for the bride will
be greater than the expense of bringing her up, she
is allowed to live; but if he apprehends straitened
circumstances before, or a failure at the time, she is
always dispatched. The disproportion of the sexes
is so great, that in a village of three thousand men
not more than three or four hundred can procure
wives. If you expostulate with them on their worse
than brutal cruelty, they reply with the mostunnaii
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 146 -->
tural apathy," Rice is dear, and no benefit will accrue
to us from rearing these children. As soon as they
are married they become the property of another; and
as they are not allowed to marry relations, or even
those of the same family name, they join another
clan, and only support them in their rivalry."


March 22d.—We arose early, and rode about
eighteen or twenty miles into the country, to a
village inhabited by natives and Chinese, and
containing a few European dwellings. We selected
Tuesday because it is the principal market-day in the
week. The Amboynese convert, to whom reference
has been made, started yesterday afternoon, with
about two hundred Malay tracts and as many
Chinese. On our arrival we found him surrounded
by the natives, and actively engaged in his
interesting work.


Tlie scene was one of lively interest. Wherever
the teacher took his station, a crowd resorted, and
listened attentively to the doctrines of the Gospel.
That the truth might be more widely proclaimed,
every part of she bazaar was visited, and in the
course of two hours not a tract remained in our

possession.


There was much of that melancholy interest on
the road which is felt when passing through the
deserted ruins of a once populous city. Extensive
avenues of trees, courts overgrown with shrubbery,
and gate-posts still standing, mark the situations
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 147 -->
where, in days of Eastern prosperity, large mansions
appeared. Batavia presents many such relics ofthe
past age. To the elder inhabitants it requires no
stretch of memory, and to the young no strength of
fancy, to conjure up the scenes of life and gaiety in
which the past generation figured. Stately buildings
again adorn the face ofthe country—the festive halls
once more are lighted—the giddy throng assemble—
peals of exhilarating music swell upon the ear, and for
a moment entrance the soul—successive nights are
spent in feasting, and every species of amusement—
and the assembly breaks up, only to restore their
flagging powers for another encounter*.


But there are other visions, of an opposite
character, belonging to the history of Batavia, and
called up by these desolations. The place is an
Aceldema, where residents and visitors, natives and
strangers, men of every country, class, and clime,
have found a common grave.


It must have required more than an ordinary
struggle to debar from the minds of the gradually
thinning, yet still assembling, votaries of pleasure, the
intruding question, " Who of us shall meet again ? "
What a strange, unnatural connexion, between the
powerful ravages of death, and the thoughtless revels


** A livin-* witness informed me that he had been present when
two hundred were invited, and the revel continued for as much of
three successive days and nights as human nature could endure.
He has known balls, with their luxurious accompaniments, kept
up, at one house, for three nights.  
  
  
  H 2
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 148 -->
ofthe dying! It is like decking the victims of the
monster with the votive wreath, and leading them
gaily forth to the dreaded altar *.


March 25th.—An hour was spent this morning in
conversation with a number of Cochin-Chinese. It
was conducted partly in French, a limited knowledge
of which they had acquired from the Roman
Catholic priests in their own country; partly in Malay,
picked up in trading; and partly by means of the
Chinese written character. They professed the
Roman Catholic religion, and evinced a degree of
caution and bigotry which had no doubt been
inspired by their calculating leaders. They spoke of
\"thousands upon thousands" of Roman Catholics
in their country, and priests from France, Portugal,
Bengal, and America; also of convents belonging to
different orders of monks. It was quite evident, from
their questions and remarks, that they had been
apprised of the exertions of Protestants, and prepared
for collision.


A tract was presented to them containing nothing
obnoxious to Catholicism, but their imagination filled
it with the most pernicious doctrines; and though
they did not read a single page, they were perfectly
aware, they said, of its soul-destroying contents.


* If from what has been ascribed to an exhausting sun and
pestilential malaria, were deducted the effects of the excitable and
irregular living of the East, Batavia and other tropical regions
would be stripped of many of those sepulchral associations wilh
which they are now shrouded.
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 149 -->
Their principal objections to the religion of the Dutch
and English were, the want of celibacy among the
priests, and of auricular confession among the people.
They spoke of the instruction they had derived from
catechisms—such as the frequent worship of " la tres
sainte Vierge"—but upon being asked if they had
read the Bible, replied in Chinese, " It was forbidden,
disapproved; " adding in French, " It is contraband."
One of them inquired of Mr. M. how many disciples
he had. He replied, that he deemed something
beyond a mere profession indispensable to true
religion, and consequently never included in such an
estimate those who were not sincere. " Ah," said
the shrewd inquirer, " the fault is in your doctrines;
if they were true there would be no lack of genuine
disciples." He was asked what he considered true
doctrine. " Oh," said he ironically, " your books are
full of it." " But you know nothing of the contents
of our books, and how are you qualified to condemn
them." " I have no time," said he, "to prattle any
longer with you," and he waited only long enough
to hear that the truth was of sufficient importance to
demand his time, and that a good man ought to
make it a matter of most diligent inquiry *.


* Since writing the above, ten Roman Catholic missionaries,
including four natives and six Europeans, have arrived at Batavia,
on their way to Cochin-China. They state that there are three
hundred thousand Roman Catholics in Cochin-China and Tonquin.
According to the authority upou which the number of Roman
Catholics is given in China, there are in Tonquin and Cochin-China four
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 150 -->

This, then, is the effect of Romanism, falsely
termed Christianity, and this the barrier it erects
against the pure doctrines of the Cross. If the word
of these men can be relied on, how widely prevalent
must be its errors, and how anti-Christian its influence
in Cochin-China!


March 29th. — Having made arrangements for
a tour of about sixteen or eighteen miles in the
country, we arose this morning, ancl pursued our
journey for some distance by the light of the moon.
The undisturbed serenity ofthe hour,the sombre shade
of the forests, and the pale beauties of the open
landscape, the freshness of the dewy morning, and,
above all, the tranquillizing influence of the moon,
combined to produce the most delightful effect upon
the mind, sobered by a temporary suspension of
thought, and still unruffled by the cares of the
day.


On account ofthe frequent rains, and the bad state
of those roads which are not kept at the expense of
Government, we were obliged to change our mode of
conveyance after the first four miles, and to make
the whole of the remaining journey on horseback.
Such was the depth and tenacity of the mud in some
places that the horses could scarcely proceed; and
the bridges, which were covered with a wicker-work

Bishops, fifteen European missionaries, upwards of one hundred
native missionaries, and more than four hundred thousand
converts. More than three-fourths of this number are in Tonquin,
now subject to Cochin-China.
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 151 -->
of bamboo, were so wet and smooth before the sun
appeared, that on one of them my horse slipped, and
fell in an instant. Mercifully I found myself
standing at his side, or my limbs would probably have been
crushed.


There was nothing remarkable in the face of the
country. The land was generally level; the smaller
elevations being selected for the site of native villages,
and the low grounds covered with rice. We passed
near the establishment of the former Rajah of the
island. The only insignia of royalty remaining, are
three or four beautiful waringin trees, always planted
in Java before the houses of native princes.


One of the descendants ofthe royal family joined
us on horseback, and continued with us for some
distance. He conversed sensibly on the subject of
religion, and, although professedly Mahommedan, did
not pretend to palliate the evil consequences of some
of the Prophet's doctrines, nor refuse to receive a
Christian book.


About nine o'clock we reached a small settlement
of Portuguese, whose ancestors, by the might and
power of the sword, were obliged to renounce
Catholicism and embrace the Protestant faith. Having left
word that we would return in time to preach, we
continued our journey about three miles farther, to
the market-place.


In this part of our way the country was adorned
with the most extensive groves of cocoa-nut trees I
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 152 -->
ever beheld. The oil of this nut is much employed by
the natives, both in cookery, and in anointing their
bodies. By the time we reached our destination, the
rays of the sun were very oppressive; but the sheds
under which the natives were assembled afforded
some relief, and enabled us to prosecute our labours.
Mr. M. and the Amboynese convert, who
accompanied us, spent two or three hours in preaching to
the natives and distributing books. The crowd was
not as great as at the other places we had visited,
although the tracts were disposed of with little
difficulty.


We noticed two or three young men, better habited,
and apparently more intelligent, than the common
class, whose conduct indicated opposition to our
object. Having watched their suspicious movements,
and found that they were not satisfied with the tracts
they had procured, but were impudently helping
themselves to others, Mr. M. took from them what
they had received, and refused to let them have a
single one. This determined measure had the desired
effect; they soon disappeared.


We returned to the Portuguese settlement about
mid-day, and, after resting an hour, and taking some
refreshment, were invited to the house of God by the
familiar tones ofthe church-going bell. About thirty
convened in an old building, erected in 1674, in the
ancient style of Dutch architecture. Mr^Medhurst
addressed the assembly, endeavouring to impress
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 153 -->
upon them some ofthe lessons cf Christianity, which
it was very evident they knew merely in theory.
They had been favoured with the labours of a
missionary, whose bones now repose before the door of
the church. To me the occasion was unusually
impressive, and, though I understood but little of the
language, my reflections were, I hope, not without
profit. It was strange to find a house dedicated to
the service of the true God in this sequestered spot
in a heathen land—strange that it should have stood
a century and a half in such a place—and still more
deplorable than strange that its light should have
been so completely lost, during all this time, in the
darkness that surrounds it.


I was surprised and grieved to find that the
missionary conceived himself under no obligations to
preach to che unchristianized natives, and that their
unhallowed feet were not allowed to tread the
threshhold of this sacred place. No wonder that its own
children have dwindled to a handful, and that its
light has become well nigh extinct.


March 31st.—This evening we attended service in
the Dutch church, preparatory to the sacrament.
This ordinance is administered twice a year in
Batavia, one of these occasions being good Friday,
which occurs to-morrow. The clerk was reading
the Bible when we entered, and continued doing so
until the dominie commenced. Singing, ancl reading  
  
  
  H 5
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 154 -->
the Scriptures are always continued half an hour
before the service, during which time it is expected that
all the congregation will assemble.


The order of service was very different from that
observed in the Dutch churches in America. The
minister commenced by pronouncing a blessing upon
the congregation, which was received standing; after
which a hymn was sung, the exordium remotum
delivered, and prayer offered. Then the text was
given out, and the first division of the subject
exhausted; this was followed by singing, a long
exhortation to alms-giving, and two collections for the
church and the poor. These were received in a black
bag, with a small bell at the bottom. When the
exhortation to charity was concluded, the deacons
left their places, and the second division of the
subject was resumed, and continued, amid the noise and
confusion oftheir employment, and for about half an
hour after they had finished. Another hymn was
then sung; after which all who expected to commune
on the approaching day were requested to rise, and
answer a number of questions respecting their faith.
With a very few exceptions the whole congregation
rose. This was succeeded by prayer, reading the
names of new members, a hymn, and the blessing.
My companion, who understood the sermon, repeated
its substance on our return home. The subject was
the burial of the Saviour by Joseph of Arimathea and
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 155 -->
Nicodemus. The speaker was animated and eloquent,
but his exhibition of doctrine and character was
lamentably defective.


The Dutch church in these islands was planted
nearly at the time when our forefathers colonized
New Amsterdam. That zeal for the Saviour's glory,
and attachment to the doctrines of her standards,
characterized the eastern branch of the mother church
equally with the western, is proved by historic
testimony. We have one of the least ambiguous evidences
of this fact in the ardour and enterprize with which
her ministers engaged in the duty of evangelizing
the heathen around them. The Bible was translated,
works of much utility and merit were written,
preaching was commenced, schools opened—in fact,
every thing which could be attempted for the heathen
was done by these men. Missionary societies were
then unknown.


How long the church continued unimpeachable in
doctrines and morals, we have no means of
ascertaining. The history, as far as it goes, and tradition
subsequently, depend for their faithfulness so much
upon the sentiments of those by whom they were
written or preserved, that unless we can determine
the character of the recorder or narrator, we cannot
decide upon the right interpretation of his facts.


The deterioration of the churches at home—the
neglecting to appoint chaplains when the Company
was disorganized—the subordination of the ministry to
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 156 -->
the secular power*—the dissipated habits of Eastern
society—added to the worldly spirit and unsound faith
of many of the chaplains—are quite sufficient to
account for the sad change which came over this
once flourishing part of the Saviour's vineyard.


April 5th.—To-day is the commencement of the
cheng heng, in the Mandarin dialect tsing ming,
season, when the Chinese repair to the graves of the
deceased, and sacrifice to their manes. Desirous of
improving the opportunity, we visited the largest
cemetery in the vicinity of Batavia, and spent part
of the morning in conversation and distributing
tracts. Many thousands were present, though in
none could we discover that solemnity or sadness
which is generally connected in our minds with the
place of the dead, and which might be thought to
result from communion with invisible spirits.


The graves, with a few exceptions, were adorned
with coloured paper. One of the sepulchres of the
great was covered with mats, and converted into a
scene of pompous ceremony and shameful carousal.
This tomb was more magnificent than any thing ofthe
kind I had seen inChina. It occupied ground enough
for a hundred ordinary graves, was composed of a
high and spacious mound, with a platform of cement
in front, surrounded by a wall and decorated with

Ulcers as from the disposition of the general Government.
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 157 -->
figures, more like lions than any other creatures of
earthly shape, were seated on pedestals to guard the
entrance. On the platform, covering an area of about
fifty feet by twenty, was spread a table, with a great
variety of viands, fruits, preserves, &c, denominated
a sacrifice to the dead, but designed to gorge the
living. Before the table two men were kneeling; one
with his head to the ground, the other holding a
small tablet in his hand, from which he read, for the
information of the departed spirit, an address
concerning the devotion of the relatives and their desire
to be reciprocally honoured. The tablet was written
in a corruption of the Mandarin dialect, which is
generally considered to be the most dignified
expression of the Chinese character. This being performed,
the men arose, the assembly began to talk and
laugh, the music struck up, and the dead were
soon forgotten. We did not remain to witness the
revel which ensued*.


Stages were erected before the temple, upon which
children were acting for the amusement of the
populace. Mr. Medhurst was interrupted in publishing
the Gospel to this multitude, by a derangedChina
* The tombs of the wealthy generally face a pond of water,
and extend to its edge. The Chinese have a strange superstition
connected with what they term fung shuy, which expression
means wind and water, and appears to be applied to the science of
determining the sites of buildings and graves. When the dead are
displeased with the situation of their sepulchres, some temporal
calamity generally a want of success in making money—is thought
to be the certain evidence and infliction. A small temple is erected
on the ground, most frequently dedicated to the god of happiness,
and believed to conciliate the spirit of the place.
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 158 -->
man, who has either conceived a strange disposition
to ridicule the missionary, or been incited by others
to oppose him. He appeared with a book in his hand,
after the manner of Mr. M., and pretended to quote
a passage and explain it to the people. His
conversation to-day was very obscene; generally he broaches
some most absurd sentiment, which he gravely
repeats in the reading dialect, as though borrowed
from a sacred book, and then descants on its meaning
in the colloquial, to the great amusement of his
auditory. Many tracts were distributed, and many
instructions delivered, before we returned.


7th.—This morning we visited a temple dedicated
to Twa-Sai-Yah, the son of a mandarin who
presided over the district of Teon-Twa-Tokieii province.
The image is represented with an extended sword in
the right hand. The father was appointed to office
under the present dynasty; and it is remarkable that
the alleged circumstance for which the son was
deified, so incredible in its nature and yet so widely
credited, should be of such recent date. On the
arrival of the mandarin at the place of his
appointment, he was informed that a gigantic snail, or rather
an incarnate elf under that form, held its abode in a
lake or pond of the district, and annually devoured
hundreds of men. The son of the officer, a heroic
youth, on hearing this, seized a sword, plunged into
the pond, and appeared no more. The water was
drained, and the young man was found standing
upon the monster, having transfixed his body, and,
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 159 -->
rather than lose his prey, held him in that position
until they both had perished.


The men who have erected the temple we visited,
and who come from that district of China, say that
the shell of this huge creature has been employed
for an incense vase, in a temple erected tothe honour
of the hero, ever since the event, and that it
measures one yard in diameter. It is from a strange idea
that men distinguished on earth are equally
distinguished in heaven, and capable of affording assistance
to mortals, that they are induced to multiply their
temples upon the demise of every extraordinary
character.


Mr. M. has witnessed some of the incantations
which they practise in order to obtain the inspiration
of such deified men. Upon the performance of some
ridiculous ceremony, the subject of it becomes
convulsed, exerts himself with violence, frequently cuts
his body with a sword, and when necessarily
composed, owing to the exhaustion induced by effort and
pain, he is thought to be tranquillized by the influence
of the deity, and prepared to answer such questions
as are proposed. As the inquiries are generally
about matters of deep interest, his replies are noted
down with all possible dispatch, and his advice
carefully and confidently followed. The evidence of true
inspiration, is the rapidity with which his wounds
heal, and the success which attends his prescriptions.  
  
  
  How far Satan may be allowed to assist in these
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 160 -->
delusions, none can determine; but that there must
either be something like infernal intervention, or most
stupid credulity—perhaps both—appears very
probable to those who have any tolerable acquaintance
with heathen lands.


April 14th.—This afternoon vve rode about six
miles into the country, and attended a Chinese
ceremony which reminded us of the " bloody rites of
Moloch." It occurs on the birth-day of one ofthe
Taou gods, and is performed by running barefoot
through a large heap of ignited charcoal. The pile,
which was about ten or twelve feet square, and nearly
two feet in height, threw out an intense heat. The
crowd was large, and the crash of gongs almost
deafening. On our arrival we found two priests
standing near the fire earnestly reading a book,
though the noise drowned their voices, and performing
a variety of strange acts, apparently enjoined in its
pages. One of them held a cow's horn in his
hand, with which he occasionally added to the noise;
while the other, after burning paper and making his
obeisance, advanced to the fire, sprinkled water upon
the heap, struck it violently with a sword, threw in
more of the paper, bowed his head, and frequently
gazed upwards with an expression of most intense
earnestness, his whole body being, as might be
expected, bathed in perspiration. After this they both
approached the fire, went through a number of antics,
and finally dashed through the coals. A passage
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 161 -->
was kept clear from an adjacent temple to the spot,
and as soon as the priests had set the example, a
number of persons, old and young, came running
from the temple with idols in their hands, and carried
them through the fire. Others followed the example,
and among them an old man, who rather staggered
than walked into the midst of the heap. This
part of the ceremony lasted but a few minutes, and
the crowd soon dispersed.


It is thought to be a test of the moral character of
those who attempt it. If they have a " true heart,"
and faith in the god, it is alleged they are never
injured. It is performed by some in fulfilment of a
vow made in times of danger or necessity. One of
the votaries last year fell down in the midst of the
pile, and was severely burned. O ur budget of Chinese
tracts was disposed of as speedily as they could be
handed out: indeed it was necessary to check their
violence in snatching them away.


26th.—Mr. Medhurst has a number of schools,
both Malay and Chinese, in which Christian books
are introduced, and over which himself and Mr.
Young maintain a strict superintendence. The
parents are willing that he should have the direction
of the school, on condition that he pay a proportion
of the teacher's wages. I have visited them many
times, and have been favourably impressed by the
course pursued in rendering intelligible to their
minds the truths of Christianity and the absurdity of
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 162 -->
Paganism. It is certainly one of the most effectual
means which could be adopted of establishing the
one system upon the ruins of the other.


In striking contrast to these, and indeed to all
schools conducted on the ordinary principles of
European teaching, are the attempts of the native
school-masters to instruct their pupils.


This morning we walked a short distance into the
country, to distribute tracts in the adjacent campongs,
and among the travellers who are constantly passing
to and from the town. The noise of school-boys
attracted our attention; and, upon coming to the shed
in which they were assembled, we found fifteen of
the native children conning the Arabic Koran in a
loud sin°*-song* tone. Not seeing the teacher, we
inquired for him, and found that he was employed in
cultivating his land, some distance from them, while
they amused themselves in this unprofitable exercise.
The teacher confessed that he did not understand
what was contained in the book, and that he was
persuaded of the unprofitableness of such
instructions as he could give; but he said the importunity
of the parents imposed a necessity upon him.


To read the Koran in a certain tone of voice,
without comprehending a word of its meaning, is the
object and acme of education among the indolent
Malays. The only advantage is, that they become
acquainted with the Arabic character, which is
employed in writing their own language, and which
<!-- Leaf 201, Page: 163 -->
assists them to understand Christian books in the
vernacular tongue. They are generally willing to
attend to any religious conversation, and seldom
refuse a tract, especially when its contents are
previously made the subject of remark.


May 6th (Friday).—On Wednesday morning, at
six o'clock, we left this place in a Government vehicle,
and reached Bitenzorg, the residence of the Governor,
in about four hours. The distance is thirty-nine
miles. The Governor, it is said, performs the journey
iu two hours and a half, or three hours, and men of
less distinction and fewer advantages generally in
four. Our conveyance was exceedingly shabby, and
the horses puny and way-worn. Although
apprehensive that the old vehicle might give way, nothing
occurred to stop our progress but the escape of one of
the poneys, which, by some unaccountable means,
cleared himself from the harness and ran away.


The palace, as the residence of the Governor is
called, is rather a splendid edifice, built in the form
of a crescent, though with a glaring architectural
blunder. It has one window more on one side than
on the other, which makes the building appear as
though it had a deficiency in the curve. It has a
park in front, stocked with deer; and an extensive
garden in the rear, laid out and ornamented in a
handsome style. The ground is undulating, the
walks are broad and well gravelled, the trees and
shrubbery rare and beautiful, and the scene is adorned
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 164 -->
with lakes, bridges, a small island, a jet-d'eau, and
a cascade. It is kept up at an expense to
Government of seven thousand rupees a month.


Between Bitenzorg and the neighbouring
mountains, which lift their lofty heads ten or eleven
thousand feet above the sea, the face of the country is
much more diversified and beautiful than the low
unvarying level of Batavia. We were in hopes of
having a clear view of the crater, the smoke of which
is distinctly seen from Batavia, but an intervening
peak completely hid it from our sight before we
reached Bitenzorg. Among the objects of curiosity
in this place is an old tablet, the characters of which,
as far as I have been able to ascertain, are entirely
distinct from any thing to be found in present use,
or in antiquarian research.


Our time was spent in visiting the Chinese and
native villages, and distributing tracts. The camp
ofthe Chinese—for so their settlements are
denominated—is extensive and populous. They listened
attentively to the instructions of Mr. Medhurst, and
received the books with pleasure.


In our visits among the Javanese we called upon
the ex-royal family, who still exercise the highest
functions entrusted by Government to the natives.
Their establishment is very commodious, and though
without splendour, much superior to any of the
buildings I have yet seen. The present Governor is
fifty-seven years of age; and his father, who in his
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 165 -->
old age has become a Mahommedan priest,
eightyone. There are five generations now living, and the
old man numbers no less than two hundred and fifty
descendants. Our books were received at the palace
with politeness, and a number of them distributed in
the villages.


The principal Chinaman in authority at Bitenzorg
returned to Batavia with us. Though without any
apparent regard for Christianity, he appears so well
persuaded of the absurdity and evil consequences of
many of the established superstitions, that he has
been opposing them by all the weight of his
authority, and with considerable success. A small
temple, which they venerated for its mystic
influence, has been removed, and houses have been
erected on its site. The custom of calling in those
to prescribe for the sick, whom they suppose to have
the power of being possessed by the devil at their
pleasure, and to whose absurd vagaries they attach
the highest virtue, has been abolished. The
influence of the priests has been attacked and diminished;
and other measures are contemplated, which will tend,
though unintentionally on his part, to prepare the way
for a purer and less cumbrous faith. Mr. M. spent
great part of the time in teaching the nature and
enforcing the reasonableness of the Christian religion
upon the mind of our fellow-traveller. Wherever we
go there is an extensive field of usefulness, all
prepared to the labourer's hand.
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 166 -->

These facts, recorded at the time, shew what an
extensive sphere there is for missionary exertion in
Java. At the same time they give but a very partial
view of the various scenes of labour and interest
which might have been visited daily, had our number
been at all in proportion to our opportunities of
usefulness. The towns, the roads, the native schools,
and, above all, the passers, or bazaars (as they are
termed in India), which are held in every part of the
surrounding country, furnish scope for the zeal of a
large number of missionaries.


These labours, together with the regular services
in English and Malay, the visitation of the Chinese,
the superintendence of schools, the never-ending
study of languages and preparation of books; besides
all the various charitable objects in which the
missionary must be the chief agent, and his own domestic
duties of every day's recurrence; constitute the
immense burden which is made to rest upon the
shoulders of one man. Soon may this neglected
island receive from the Christian world that attention
which is its due !


The three large settlements, Batavia, Samarang,
and Soerabaya, ought to be immediately occupied,
and made the head-quarters of missionary operation.
From these points " ihe light of life " might radiate,
until the rays met in every part of this dark domain.  
  
  
  The writer must add, with pain, that, since the
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 167 -->
above was written, the prospect of unrestrained effort
has assumed a less flattering aspect than when he
resided at Batavia. Mr. Bruckner, who was absent
at that time from the island for the purpose of
printing some works in the Javanese language, and
who returned soon afterwards, was arrested by the
authorities, in the midst of a most interesting series
of labours. The eager natives were thronging his
house to receive the tracts he brought with him,
when the Government officers interfered, took away
the books, and placed'a veto upon their future
distribution.


The following fact is extracted from the fifth
numberof the first-volume of theChineseRepository—
aworkdeservingthe perusal of all who take an interest
in the history, literature, religion, present condition,
and prospects of China and the neighbouring
kingdoms and islands. "Tbe whole population of a small
village, wishing* to become Christians, and to be
instructed in the truths of the Gospel, requested the
Resident at Soerabaya to send them a teacher, with
Bibles. This he refused, declaring that he would
not allow them to become Christians, as they were
quite happy enough without Christianity; and
further, that Christian tracts, in the Javanese
language, have been confiscated, and the funds of the
Dutch Bible Society occasionally applied to purposes
merely literary."  
  
  
  It is the opinion of those who have recently visited
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 168 -->
Java, that the most serious embarrassments would
be thrown in the way of extensive missionary
operations. They say that it now requires permission
from the Government at home for a foreigner to
become burgher, and that those who are not
enfranchised cannot travel in the interior. Besides this,
the local officers have it in their power to prevent the
circulation of books among the natives, and they
appear determined to exercise that power. These
facts certainly cannot have been rightly represented
to the King of Holland, or we have reason to believe
that the evils would soon be corrected. The bugbear
of insurrection, by which those who oppose missions
profess to be frightened themselves, and attempt to
scare others, cannot alarm one who knows the
tendency of Christian principles. We sincerely
hope that the subject will be investigated by the
authorities in the mother country, and that the
present and eternal happiness of so many millions
of souls will not be allowed to yield to the cruel and
unwise policy of a few local officers. If the same
liberty which is enjoyed throughout every part of
British India were allowed the missionaries in this
and the neighbouring islands, rebellions would be no
more frequent than in Hindostan, and the greatest
advantage would soon be realized by all parties.

  CHAPTER IX.  
  
  
  PASSAGE FROM JAVA TO SINGAPORE.

On Saturday evening, June 4th, I embarked in
the English ship Bencoolen, Captain Roberts, for
Singapore. The next morning, before day-break, we
weighed anchor, and, availing ourselves of the land
breeze, stood to sea. After sailing gently for a day
or two, and passing a few unimportant islands, we
entered the Straits of Banca, between the island of that
name and Sumatra. The tin mines on Banca, in
the possession of the Dutch, are said to yield a large
quantity of good metal.


The immense island of Sumatra, extending about
one thousand miles in length, and varying from one
to two hundred in breadth, lay before us like a
motionless sea. The maritime parts on both sides
are low and marshy, though it is intersected
longitudinally by chains of unequal mountains, some of
them nearly as high as the loftiest summits of the
Alps. We passed the mouths of several large rivers,
the current from which appeared to reach the opposite
6ide of the strait.  
  
  
  Sumatra is divided into a number of distinct,  
  
  
  i
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 170 -->
independent kingdoms; the most important of which
are known by the names of Menangkaboo Balla, and
Ballumary or Kampang.


In former times the whole island was subject to
the kingdom of Menangkaboo, and at the present
day its sultan combines the influence of a sovereign
prince with that ofa Moslem pontiff. The Dutch,
before their recent expulsion and massacre, had
succeeded in conquering this strong-hold of the
country, and establishing themselves, as they thought,
in perpetual security. Had they retained their
dearly bought possession, they could, in all probability,
have commanded the resources of the island. A
carriage road connects this central spot with Padang,
about a half-a-day's journey to the west; and a large
river opens a free communication with the east, by
which its products are transported to Singapore.
The inhabitants of this ancient kingdom were early
converted to Islamism. Pangarooyoong, its capital,
is a chief resort of pilgrims of that religion, and was
formerly the great seat of literature in the island.
The natives of Menangkaboo have outstripped all
their neighbours in letters and the arts. They have
borrowed the Arabic character, and " their whole
literature consists in transcripts from the Koran, and
in bold historic tales." They have long been famed
for their delicate workmanship in gold, and for the
manufacture of arms.  
  
  
  In the country of Balla, which includes the
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 171 -->
northern division of the island, is the famous
kingdom of Acheen, with which foreigners are well
acquainted. It carries on a considerable trade with
some parts of India; its sultan being the principal
merchant of the place. The inhabitants are more
muscular, industrious, and sagacious, than the other
natives of the island: they profess the faith of
Mahommed, and are said to exemplify some of its
sanguinary principles. They are under the iron sway
of a hereditary despotism, and subject to laws as
rigorous as they are partial in their penal inflictions.
The most severe punishments generally fall upon the
lowest classes of society.


In the interior of this general division of the
island, is the beautiful country ofthe Battas, part of
which stretches over a spacious champaign between
two ridges of mountains, and is adorned with an
extensive lake. This region of the island, as also
that of Acheen, is represented as exceedingly
populous; it is subdivided into numerous petty
principalities, occupied by independent tribes. The
natives, though spirited, have shewn themselves
inoffensive in their conduct towards traders, and
respectful and hospitable towards the Europeans
who have occasionally visited them. They are
described as fairer and smaller than the Malays; fond
of dress; and more partial to horse-flesh than to any
other species of animal food. Polygamy is common
among them. The women are employed as slaves,  
  
  
  i 2
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 172 -->
while the men pass away the time in war, indolence,
gambling, and childish amusements. Such is their
estimate of the difference between the sexes, that
they visit the same offence with a much more severe
punishment upon the men, than upon their more
ignorant and less culpable wives. They shew their
detestation of certain crimes by devouring the
criminal; prisoners of war often receive no better
treatment. Like the generality of heathen tribes,
they are exceedingly superstitious in matters of
sorcery. They believe in two deities, of totally opposite
character; though the best informed writers affirm
that they have no idea ofa future state. The Dutch
settlements of Tapanooly and Natal lie in this section
of the island. Like the inhabitants of Acheen,
they entertain a superstitious regard for the sultan of
Menangkaboo.


In Ballumary, or Kampang, the third division
mentioned, are the kingdom of Palembaug, and the
country ofthe Lampoons. The former comprehends
the south-eastern portion of Sumatra, and the latter
extends to its southern extremity. Immense and
impenetrable forests cover a large region of this
southern division of the island : the inhabitants are
generally poor, and their customs much the same
as those of their neighbours. Palembaug, where the
Dutch had a factory, is described as a large city,
inhabitedby emigrants from China, Siam, and Java, as
well as by the natives ofthe country.
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 173 -->

Besides these kingdoms there are many
independent states, situated on almost every large river, and
whose general features are much the same as those
of the tribes already described.


What an immense sphere does this island present
for missionary exertion ! The Dutch and English
have alternately held the foreign stations ofthe island,
and the latter have sent a few missionaries to
Bencoolen and Padang; but the great work of converting
the millions of its inhabitants to Christ was neither set
about nor prosecuted with sufficient energy. At
present there is not a single missionary upon the
island. The writer became acquainted with a
pious gentleman, resident at Padang, who promised
to furnish such a statement of the country and its
inhabitants as would interest the Christian
community, and supply hints for their benevolent efforts.
Since then the Dutch have been forcibly driven from
their settlements, and many of them massacred by the
enraged natives; and whether the person referred to,
and a companion of congenial sentiments, have
escaped, is uncertain, as no intelligence has been
received from them since the dreadful catastrophe.


Some of the islands near the west coast of Sumatra
are described as fertile and populous. Pulo Nyas
is inhabited by an interesting race of men, who are
remarkably ingenious, and carry on an extensive
traffic. The place seems to present an exceedingly
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 174 -->
favourable opening for missionary labours, and we
know of no obstacles to their immediate
commencement.


Along the whole line of this western coast of
Sumatra, and among the adjacent islands, the pious
merchant has it in his power to exert the greatest
influence. It is a favourite resort for trading vessels
from England and America, and, according to the
testimony of one who has been engaged in the traffic,
the most dishonest and dishonourable means are often
employed in defrauding the natives. Should houses
of commerce, superintended by pious agents, be
established in the most populous and advantageous
positions; and should ships, in their visits to other
places of trade, carry with them those who are capable
of instructing the natives; immense good would
infallibly accrue to the heathen.


On our way to Singapore we passed a number of
islands, which are occupied by pirates, who infest
the adjacent seas, and watch for such vessels as they
suppose may be safely and successfully attacked.
Three masts generally afford a security; though some
ships have been assailed notwithstanding, and those
of the crew who remained to tell the tale, with
difficulty effected their escape. We saw a number of
proas in the Straits of Banca, but either our
appearance was too formidable to invite an encounter, or
they too peaceful to attack us.
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 175 -->

The Sabbath was a day of delightful serenity, and
the enjoyment of its hallowed privileges added not a
little to its tranquillizing features. The willingness
with which the tracts were received and read, by both
passengers and crew, afforded a fresh proof of the
importance of being always furnished with a supply
of these powerful and unobtrusive monitors.


On Monday morning we weighed anchor early,
having been becalmed the previous night, and stood
through the straits lying between Pulo Battam and
the Great Dryon. It is doubtful whether any ships
had passed that way since 1803. It proved to be a
safe, and in many respects an advantageous passage.
The land on both sides is uniform, and the scenery
perfectly wild, and rather interesting. I do not
recollect ever to have sailed so great a distance
among such a number of scattered islands.


On Tuesday morning, June 14th, the ship came
to anchor in Singapore Roads. The harbour of
Singapore is very extensive. It is surrounded by numerous
islands, stretching far in the distance, and is capable
of affording safe anchorage to any number of shipping.


There is nothing very striking in the aspect of
the place. The site ofthe business part ofthe town
is either a depresssd hill or a redeemed jungle.
Most of the private residences are situated upon a
plain of considerable extent; while a few mansions,
crowning the adjacent hills, relieve the dull uniformity
which a level situation gives to so many Eastern
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 176 -->
towns. Being a free port for all but Americans,
many European ships and native craft are generally
lying in the harbour.


On my arrival I found the missionaries well, and
Mr. Tomlin on the eve of embarking for Siam. Mr.
{empty}T. had been waiting a long time for an opportunity,
and this very vessel had been detained, contrary to all
expectation, beyond the appointed period of sailing.
The very day of my arrival she obtained her port
clearance, but, through the compliance of the
captain, the time of sailing was deferred until Friday
morning. By this concurrence of circumstances an
opportunity was providentially afforded for making
all those arrangements which seemed most important,
before leaving Singapore.


It was cheering to find from the missionaries, that
the same disposition to receive Christian books which
was manifested by the Malays at Batavia, prevailed
also at this and some of the neighbouring stations.
The change is of very recent date, and the hearts
and hands of the missionaries are strengthened in
their work.


On Friday, June 17th, we embarked in an Arab
vessel, with a European commander, for Siam. Mr.
Tomlin; Mr. Daniell, a pious officer in the Indian
army; and myself, were obliged to occupy the same
half of the poop-cabin. The opposite side contained
two of the supercargo's wives, who were never seen
by any but their husband and servants. The crew
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 177 -->
consisted of forty-six men, chiefly Arabs, and
consequently Mahommedans. There was something in
their expressive features and muscular forms which
completely distinguished them from the Bengalese
and Malays. The prominent nose, penetrating eye,
curling locks, and heavy beard, characterized the
greater number. Their conduct, too, was strikingly
opposed to any thing I had ever witnessed in any
other vessel. Five times a day they bent the knee
and bowed the head in social worship. The principal
services are performed at day-dawn and sun-set.


At these seasons the muezzin ascended the
quarter-deck—the only thing on board-ship which would
answer the purpose of a minaret—and, stopping his
ears with his fingers, to exclude all earthly sounds,
proclaimed in the most serious manner the appointed
hour for prayer. He was soon joined by the majority,
who, with their faces toward the west, the direction
of the Moslem's kiblah from our present position,
spent about half an hour in their fruitless task.
They heed not the presence of man; never miss the
hour of prayer; and express an earnestness which
testifies that they have not the most remote suspicion
of their dreadful delusion. The mate generally leads
the devotions, standing a short distance in advance
of the rest. The countenances of some of them
were deathfully solemn; and their voices, especially
when mingled in general response, of a deep
sepulchral tone.  
  
  
  I 5
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 178 -->

In their intercourse with each other they evince a
cheerfulness, and apparent affection, which is seldom
found among European sailors. There is, it is true,
much less distinction between the officers and
common sailors, and much more liberty taken by the
latter, than in the generality of other vessels; but
every object of subordination is gained; and though
inclined to sport, the command is obeyed with prompt
activity. These deluded men entertain a belief that
within two centuries all Christians are to be
converted to their faith. I could almost wish for the
gift of tongues, to be the instrument of teaching
them their error, and pointing them to that
Saviour, whose spreading kingdom will blot out the
very name of their deceiver from under heaven,
perhaps long before that period has elapsed. Some, to
whom Arabic Bibles were offered, received them with
pleasure, and devoted much time to their
examination. They soon discovered the inconsistency between
the practice of nominal Christians, and the precepts
of the Saviour.


Our room was consecrated to the worship of the
true God, and the sacrifice of morning and evening
praise was there offered up. The usual services ofthe
Sabbath were also performed. The Captain, the only
European on board, attended on all these occasions.


We had the coast of the Malayan peninsula and the
neighbouring islands in view, for the first half of the
passage. The former is a range of abrupt, irregular
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 179 -->
hills, flanked in many places by peaks of the same
character, though of different altitudes, and
presenting an appearance which might be easily
mistaken by the distant observer for towers, pagodas,
minarets, fortifications, and castles. We were
frequently struck with the sun-set splendour of the
heavens, and led to admire the glories of that Being of
whom his most lovely works are but a faint reflection.


On Thursday, June 30th, 1831, we arrived at the
bar off the mouth of the Meinam, and cast anchor.
The coast of Siam is so low, that at the usual distance
of the horizon at sea it can be distinguished only as
a roughness, without any undulation. English vessels
are obliged, by the treaty with that Government, to
wait here for a pilot. It is said to be impossible for
large ships to cross the bar except at the highest
tides; the water seldom exceeding eighteen feet, and
rising at times not above twelve or fourteen.
Understanding that the pilot would not be on board for a
week, we left the ship on Saturday in the jolly-boat
for Bankok. About five o'clock we reached Paknam,
a small village some three or four miles from the
shore of the sea.


The Siamese have attempted to render the river
impassable to foreign invaders. A barrier of large
piles, many yards in width, runs from one bank tothe
other, with the exception of a narrow passage for
vessels; each shore is lined with a battery; and a
large fortification or castle has been erected in the
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 180 -->
stream, to command the approach, as well as to
obstruct the passage. The appearance of this castle,
with a small spiral pagoda or monument at a short
distance, is imposing and beautiful.


It was our intention to pass Paknam without
stopping; but the King's officers hailed us, and the
Governor detained the Captain about an hour. The
old gentleman employed the time in asking such
questions, and offering such remarks, as were dictated
by his curiosity, and his still more insatiable
cupidity. During this interview, the passengers,
who had remained in the boat, afforded considerable
amusement to the natives, by partaking of a cold
repast. We prevailed upon them to taste the biscuit
and beer on which we were feasting, and received,
in return, shell-fish, and segars made of a dried leaf
rolled up, and enclosing a little cut tobacco. Many
of the men were muscular, and symmetrical in form,
probably selected purposely for the service in which
they are engaged.


Tbe Siamese shave the head, all but the crown,
where the hair is allowed to grow sufficiently long to
give it the uprightness and apparent rigidity of
bristles. Their dress is scanty; the limbs and upper
part of the body being exposed. There is no
difference in this respect, from the king to his meanest
subject. The women are almost as slightly clothed
as the men. It is an universal custom with both
sexes to chew the betel and cere, and, among the men,
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 181 -->
from early youth to the most decrepit age, there is
scarcely an exception to the habit of smoking.
Between the two the jaws are seldom allowed to rest.


From Paknam to Bankok the distance is about
twenty-five or thirty miles. We left the former place
about six in the evening, and arrived at half past
twelve. We were entertained on the way by many
objects of interest and novelty.


The Meinam is a noble river; its average width is
about half a mile; and it is sufficiently deep at
Bankok to admit the largest ships which can pass
the bar. Its banks are low, and covered with jungle.
The lights on the shore were numerous in many
places; and we were convinced, from their reflection
in the river, that the houses were built upon piles or
rafts. In one or two places our ears were saluted
by music, whicii came over the water, at this late
and silent hour, with a soothing melody. The
instruments were chiefly on the percussion principle,
and the soft and delicate harmony of their tones
formed a perfect contrast to the harsh strains with
which we had been tortured in China. But the
objects of our greatest admiration were the swarms of
fire-flies covering the shore, and passing from one side
of the river to the other. Though not to be
compared, in size or brilliancy, to the famed lantern-fly
(fulgora laternaria) of South America, described by
Madame Merian, still  
  
  
  " Innumerous tribes
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 182 -->
  
  From the wood-cover swarmed, and darkness made
Their beauties visible : one while they streamed
A bright blue radiance upon flowers that closed
Their gorgeous colours from the eye of day;
Now, motionless and dark, eluded search,
Self-shrouded; and anon, starring the sky,  
  
  
  Rose like a shower of fire *."


Thousands of these insects would light together
on one tree, and give it a most beautiful and vivid
illumination. There appeared to be a complete
uniformity in the motions of them all—so that the glare
would break forth and close in as though they
inhaled a common breath, or emitted their light by
some other simultaneous impulse. It required no
stretch of fancy to imagine ourselves in those fairy
regions of which we had heard in childhood,
especially as we were inclined to indulge in transient
slumbers, and would frequently awake from
forgetfulness to the novel and dreamy pictures around us.


In one place, where the natives were on the
lookout, and where, as we have since ascertained, there
is a fort, we were hailed, and asked a number of
questions. Having obtained permission to proceed,
we did not stop, but told them our destination, and
heeded not nor understood their cries.


Before we left the ship, we visited one of the
Chinese junks, which was waiting on the bar for a
favourable wind, and were much disappointed to learn
that Mr. Gutzlaff had sailed a few days before for  
  
  
  * Southey's Madoc.
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 183 -->
China. As there were Christian books in the junks,
and some of the sailors were well acquainted with
his history, there was little reason to doubt the
correctness ofthe statement. We were thus prepared
to hear that he had actually embarked on the
expedition in which his heart has been absorbed, and for
which Divine Providence had now opened a way.


Soon after midnight we reached the residence of
Signor Carlos de Silveira, the Portuguese consul,
who received us with much kindness and hospitality.
This gentleman entertained the missionaries during
the early part of their first visit; assigned them a
house on his own lands; and when they were opposed
by the Roman Catholics, and, through them, by the
native authorities, continued their warm friend,
notwithstanding the menace of expulsion from the
Siamese dominions, and loss of all his property.
The same disinterested kindness has ever been
evinced by R. Hunter, Esq., the only English
merchant in the place, who in the time of their greatest
trial received the missionaries into his house, and
exerted all his influence on their behalf—determined
to risk every thing rather than have them driven
from the kingdom. Mr. H. remains in this country,
and will doubtless ever render to the missionaries all
the assistance which his well-known character, and
the rank the king has conferred upon him, enable
him to afford.

  CHAPTER X.  
  
  
  SIAM — CONTINUED.

The writer spent six months at Siam on his first
visit; which time was devoted to the study of the
Chinese and Siamese languages, and to the ordinary
duties of the mission. A few general remarks,
founded upon the information obtained at that time,
and corrected and enlarged by a succeeding visit,
will give the reader some idea of the place and its
inhabitants.


The country, as far as regards scenery and
improvements, is extremely uninteresting. There is not
a hill—scarcely a mound—to interrupt the dead level
which spreads in a wide compass round the capital.
The soil is exceedingly productive; it surpasses, in
the rich variety and abundance of its fruits, nearly
all the adjacent regions, and is probably not surpassed
by any country ofthe East*.


Bankok, the capital, is situated upon the Meinam.
The palaces of the two kings, and of some of the


* Besides its more valuable productions, Siam abounds in the
most delicious fruits of the East, plantains, oranges, shadachs,
durians, the bread fruit, and, above all, the mangosteen and
mango, in the greatest perfection.
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 185 -->
princes, are enclosed within a wall, while the suburbs
extend about two or three miles above and below
the royal residences, on each side of the river. As
the houses are generally situated upon the water, or
near its edge, the river may be considered as the
highway, the mart and the pleasure-grounds of the
city. Here the mass of the population reside, carry
on their business, and take their recreation. The
most projecting row of houses is built upon bamboo
rafts, and moored or secured to fixtures upon shore.
Of course their locality can be changed without
difficulty, and, sometimes, without the concurrence of the
inmates. It is no uncommon thing to see them come
floating down the stream, with all their contents, set
adrift, perhaps, by ships in their vicinity, and carrying
away, in their turn, those against which they may be
driven by the impulse first received, or the eddies
into which they are whirled.


Those houses which are situated nearer the shore,
or partly on the bank ofthe river, are founded upon
piles raised above the rise of the tides. These are
generally inhabited, although some of the best are only
used as cool retreats for the kings and men of wealth,
who live on shore. In many places, the dwellings
retire some distance from the margin of the river, and
either form a narrow extended street, as on the city
side of the water; or branch off towards the interior;
or are scattered over the face of the country, amid
gardens, jungle, and rice-fields. There are many
<!-- Leaf 224, Page: 186 -->
interesting and varying views up the winding course
ofthe Meinam. The finest specimens of architecture
are the temples, which generally occupy the best
sites, and cover, with the array of monastic buildings
attached to them, a large area of ground. These, and
the palaces, glittering with gold and other ornaments,
together with a few mansions belonging to the princes,
derive no trifling part of their apparent magnificence
from the contiguity and contrast of the mean huts
composing the remainder of the city.


In passing along the river, many rural beauties
are fancied to exist on shore. A variety of palms, the
bread fruit, the silk cotton (bombax cliba), the
tamarind, with a profusion of other less majestic
though equally valuable trees—all flourishing in this
congenial soil, and blooming in the richest luxuriance
—appear like groves, and arbours, and parks; while
the houses and temples, peeping through self-formed
avenues, are mistaken for dwellings of taste and
comfort. But the place is disenchanted of its beauty
the moment the shore is gained. The temples
excepted, where some little pains and ingenuity are
displayed, every thing is improvable, but nothing
improved. Neither order, convenience, ornament, nor
comfort, are consulted in the situation and structure
of their houses.


In and near the city, a few streets have been laid
out, while in many parts, instead of accommodating
the houses to any line of roads, the roads or paths
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 187 -->
are interrupted, and bent in almost every direction,
by the encroachment of the buildings. The want of
roads and good foot-paths, and of almost all
conveniences for out-door exercise, is one of the most
serious objections to a residence in Siam. The
natives, like their god Budh, appear to luxuriate in
indolence, and consequently, when obliged to move,
are contented with the most passive modes of
locomotion. The rivers, creeks, and canals, are so
numerous, that they can go in boats to almost every place
where business or pleasure calls them.


There are many points of painful interest connected
with the state of society in Siam. Its population,
consisting of four or five millions of souls, is made
up of Siamese, natives of Laos, Carubojians, Peguins,
Malays, Burmese, descendants of Portuguese,
CochinChinese, and Chinamen.


With the exception of the Chinese, who pay a
triennial capitation sum, this whole population is
divided into two classes—those who are bound to
perpetual slavery, and those who are submitted to a
service tax of a portion of their time. The former
are either conquered enemies, from the country of
Laos and the Malayan Peninsula, or stolen subjects
from the frontiers of Burmah and Pegu. Twenty
thousand Laos captives were transferred at one time
from their native land, and distributed among the
Siamese princes and men of authority. These poor
creatures are more oppressed than all their
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 188 -->
fellowslaves. On entering the palaces of the kings, and
mansions of the great, it is distressing to witness
men and women of every age toiling in fetters, as
though the clank of their chains was music in the
ears of their cruel lords. The reason assigned for
such inhumanity, is the fear of their escape; but one
is strongly tempted to believe, from this and other
cruelties equally revolting, that they estimate their
own importance as much by the misery as the
multiplicity of their slaves. Many of this class, having
no employment at home, are sent out to labour
for the benefit of their masters; some of whom own
several thousands, and derive considerable emolument
from their services.


It is not uncommon to expose these unfortunate
beings to sale, often at the most reduced prices, and
to have them purchased even by the officers of
Government, for a traffic as vile as the deepest depravity
could suggest. Numbers of females are daily sent
forth in the most disgraceful capacity, and if they do
not return at night with the sum fixed by their
masters, they are often cruelly beaten. If they refuse
this odious life—and some of them have spurned its
debasement—the master is quite at liberty as to the
mode and measure of the punishment. To the
number of slaves already mentioned, must be added the
children whom the alleged necessities of their parents
oblige them to sell, and who are bought for any
purpose which their covetous or licentious masters
may choose.
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 189 -->

The other class referred to, who are submitted to a
service tax of part of their time, includes all the
remaining inhabitants of the country, with the
exception of the Chinese. Even the natives of Siam,
and the nominal Christians, the descendants of
Portuguese, are among the number. These, some of the
more wealthy excepted, are reduced to a state of
partial slavery, being obliged to employ much of their
time in the King's service, and receiving for their
labour the smallest compensation. If they are not
so fortunate as to lay by a small store during their
liberty for this hour of need, or if their wives and
children are unsuccessful in a petty trade, by which
many of them subsist, they and their families are
reduced to the greatest straits.


By the laws of the land, or the neglect of their
administration, they are allowed to pilfer from the
poor hucksters such eatables as their necessities
require, and their strength can secure. The Chinese
who sell vegetables and fruit, complain bitterly of
this custom—redress is out of the question. Some
of this class have little or no time to themselves—
others have the liberty of one-third, one-half, and
two-thirds of the year; what are the particular rules
of this difference I am not informed. Those slaves
and subjects who are allotted by the King to the
princes and officers of Government, have the names
of their masters written upon their arms, and are
quite at their controul.
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 190 -->

The more respectable and wealthy, mentioned as
exceptions to this system of service taxation, are
exceptions only to a limited extent. They are either
employed as civil or military officers in his Majesty's
service, or are obliged to procure a substitute for
their own bodily labour. In fact, with all their boast
of freedom—and freemen is the appellation by which
the nation is known, in their own language—Siam is
a land of slaves; the King being the only exception
to universal vassalage. His Majesty can employ any
subject, upon any business, for any length of time,
under any circumstances, and upon any conditions.
A portion of almost every day is spent by the officers
and the princes, in lying prostrate before him, and
awaiting his pleasure.


The Chinese have been mentioned as enjoying
more liberty and greater advantages than others.
Even they groan under the burden of taxes, and
when convicted of crime—often unjustly as they affirm
—are made to expiate their guilt by manual labour
continued beyond all bounds of equitable punishment.
Many of them, while toiling daily, and throughout the
day, for the King, are thrown for their sustenance upon
the mercy of their friends, the charity of the public,
or those dishonourable measures which the starving
in his Majesty's service are allowed to employ.


As a necessary consequence of these oppressive
customs, poverty is a common evil. The great mass
of the inhabitants have barely enough to support their
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 191 -->
existence, even upon the most simple fare. During
the term of service required by their masters, they
scarcely receive sufficient for their individual
maintenance; and even their own time, when made
available to private interest, is not secure from an arbitrary
call to extra service, or to war. At one season of the
year crowds of boats are moored abreast of the palace.
These belong to men who reside in the country, and
who are annually called from their homes and
ricefields, to spend two or three months in practising the
art of gracefully paddling the king's boats. During
all this term of useless service they are under the
necessity of supporting themselves, and neglecting
their families.


The misery of the nation is increased by the
corrupt administration of justice. Many of the laws are
equitable, but, alas! they are only imperative when
the judge can make them answer a private end. Of
the unwritten statutes, which, like the traditions of
the elders, are the only ones deemed practical, the
most imperative law is the royal nod; the next is
the pleasure of his prime minister; and so on, through
the descending scale of official rank, the superior has
the controul of the inferior, and his will the precedence

of the litera scripta.


The all-absorbing object, from the throne to the
lowest bench of justice, is self-aggrandizement. Even
the monarch appears to regard his own interest as
perfectly distinct from the prosperity of his subjects.
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 192 -->
In times of scarcity, as the writer has witnessed,
there is frequently no provision made for the suffering
poor, when it might be effected with little cost or
trouble. In fact, such is the power of money, that
multitudes prefer putting up with indignities and
losses—for which the law, according to its letter and
intention, would afford redress—rather than be
compelled to risk the endurance of the additional suffering
attendant on an appeal to justice, caused by
necessary bribes, or an unjust decision.


Besides these evils, over which the common people
have no controul, there are others, of a moral nature,
which greatly aggravate their present sufferings.
Among these is the abuse of the marriage contract,
with its train of complicated miseries. Polygamy is
in high vogue. The king's seraglio contains between
five hundred and a thousand women; and all the
princes -in fact the whole kingdom—have no other
limitation to numbers than their wishes and wealth.
The poorer classes are of course restricted by
necessity, and one evil is thus checked by another.


Connected with this multiplication of wives, and
its consequent relaxation of all the ties of kindred and
affection, there are other prevalent customs in Siam,
quite as fatal to human happiness. A man who is
unsuccessful in gambling, or reduced to poverty by
other means, may sell his wife, with the liberty of
redeeming her for the same sum and the expenses
she has incurred; or if his admiration of her good
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 193 -->
qualities ceases, he may put her away and procure
another. If the wife was purchased—a common
substitute for courtship—and has no children, there
is generally no difficulty in dissolving the connexion.
If she be able to pay the amount of her original
purchase, she may have the same power over her
husband. In ordinary cases, however, the
concurrence of both parties is so far necessary, that the
rejected one, whose consent has not been obtained,
can claim a support, or a sum of money as an
indemnification.


A man who fancies the wife of another can
generally obtain her, if his dignity or wealth gives him
the advantage of her husband; and a creditor, if he
can get nothing else, can take the wife and children
of the insolvent. If the happiness of individuals
and of society at large depend upon the inviolable
sanctity of the marriage contract, which its very
institution would proclaim, it will readily be believed
that such an abuse of all that is sacred in the most
important relation of life, must prove fatal to every
thing but the mere semblance of domestic enjoyment.


Gambling is another source of depravity and
wretchedness in Siam. The king derives a large
revenue from this licensed evil; and the demoniacal
spirit it engenders, and the dreadful crimes it
instigates, prove it to be a moral maelstrom, where the
happiness and hopes of thousands are for ever lost.  
  
  
  The shameless indecency of language and dress.  
  
  
  K
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 194 -->
the latter of which has been already referred to, is
also productive of great evils. The epithets of abuse
most common in this kingdom would shock vulgarity
itself in civilized countries, and yet this is the
language employed by high and low, men and women,
from the angry mother to her suckling, and from the
stammering child to its offending parent. It is
impossible to go abroad, or to listen to those who
pass the house, without hearing the vilest terms
mixed up with expressions of anger, and gracing every
effort at pleasantry.


Besides these prevalent evils, lying, cheating, and
pilfering are exceedingly common; robbery and
murder by no means rare. Those who have
commercial dealings with them, declare that dishonesty
and deceit are, with few exceptions, characteristic of
the nation. The meanness of the great to obtain
favours, especially from foreigners, is despicable.
They will accept any thing as a present, and offer
nothing worth receiving in return—they will crave
most importunately, and often cringingly, what they
know you want—they will buy, and frequently
endeavour to cheat the seller out of much of the
stipulated sum—they will borrow, and never return
—and when they can get nothing more from you,
unless they desire your society for the sake of
amusement, they never come near you.


This picture of the condition, moral and political,
of Siam is a dark one. As far, however, as a careful
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 195 -->
and minute examination can ensure correctness, it is
delineated with justice. It has its lights, and those
who have but a partial acquaintance with the place
may suppose that we give it too deep a colouring,
without considering that they behold it only in its
most favourable aspect, and through a flattering
medium.


Some of the more pleasing, and, to a hasty
inspector, more discernible parts of the picture, we have
hinted at. One is, the large number of Chinese
whose condition is better than that of their
fellowcitizens, and who make an important figure in the
business of the place. Another, is the undue
proportion of princes, who, like the feudal barons of old,
move about in considerable style, and impress the
mind with some idea of their importance. A third,
is the overwhelming number of priests, whose office
eonfers immunities—such as honour without
respectability, and support without labour.


Besides these, the majority of the common people,
who occupy the most conspicuous houses, are the
fortunate class of tradesmen and shop-keepers, from
whose prosperity it would be as unwise to deduce an
opinion of the general condition of the people, as to
take the most successful merchants at home as the
criterion of the wealth of the community at large.
Another light in the sketch, which, however, is but a
reflected one, is the exceeding productiveness of the  
  
  
  K 2
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 196 -->
country, and of course the cheapness of the
necessaries of life.


These things being the most obvious to those who
pay only a transient visit to the place, who know
nothing ofthe language, and have no opportunity of
witnessing the interior of society,they imagine, as they
do with respect to other heathen countries, that the
people are happy, and that western refinement and
religion would not improve their condition.


The religion of Siam is Buddhistic. We learn
from the best authorities that there are more than
twenty thousand priests in the kingdom, one-half or
two-thirds of whom reside in Bankok and its
vicinity. The temples are built at the expense of the
King, or the principal men in the kingdom. His
Majesty has shewn himself peculiary zealous in the
maintenance of the state religion. He has many
temples, with their monasteries, under his own
patronage, which are called by his name, and supported by
his royal bounty. These occupy the best grounds,
and are built in a style of splendour with which
nothing but the palace can compare.


A monthly allowance of rice and money from the
public treasury is set apart for the support of the
priests. Besides this, they enjoy not only the religious
merits but the temporal advantages of mendicity.
Every morning they sally forth to collect the alms of
the people, and generally succeed in getting enough,
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 197 -->
not only for themselves, but also for a host of human
and canine pensioners, whom their charity attracts
from every quarter. The rarest delicacies of the season
are among the gifts with which they are loaded; and
the women, who appear by far the most devout, never
visit the temples without carrying such presents as
their circumstances will permit.


The priesthood is composed of men of all classes
in society. The temples or monasteries are the only
schools of learning in the kingdom; and as education
is very prevalent, there is scarcely an individual who
does not pass some portion of his life in these
establishments. Admittance may be obtained on the most
easy terms. Any person may enter who can shew
that he has an official release from the service tax, is
not in debt, and has the consent of his wife or parents.
Each may remain as long or as short a time as he
pleases. When provisions are dear, many avail
themselves of this easy mode of support, and while
necessity presses, or indolence prompts, they enjoy all
the honours and profits of the yellow robe. A large
number take upon themselves the monastic vow for
life, and spend all their days in the prescribed round
of secular and sacerdotal duties.


The elders teach their younger brethren, preach at
the pagodas or in private houses, solemnize marriages,
attend at funerals, consecrate new houses, shave the
heads of children, perform certain offices for the
recovery of the sick and the absolution of the dead,
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 198 -->
and visit those scenes where their sacred presence
and magical arts are deemed necessary. In former
days they decided difficult cases of judicature by
enchantment; but since Mammon has usurped the
throne of Justice, causes are found less complicated,
and the services ofthe priests are superseded.


The priests are treated with a great shew of respect:
even the King bows down in their presence, and
the common people bestow on them the same sign of
adoration with which they honour their idols. But
this respect is little more than nominal, or, if real, it
belongs to the robe, and not to the man. His Majesty,
with all his professions of inferiority, reserves to
himself the right of stripping off this sacred garment and
punishing the unworthy wearer. Sometime ago the
principal priest, or pope, was found guilty of some
heinous misdemeanor; upon which he was disrobed,
dishonoured, and made a servant to the royal
elephants. The chief immunities attached to the
priesthood are exemption from service tax and
military duties. But here, again, the King has taken
liberties upon some occasions, and shewn that his
will and interests are superior to all the laws and
rights of religion. Some years ago, many in the
inferior grades of sanctity were drafted into the army;
which occasioned the most turbulent commotion
among them. It ended in a partial rebellion, a plot
to assassinate the king, and finally in the apprehension
of seven hundred of their own number.
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 199 -->

With so few restraints, and surrounded by so
many objects of temptation, it is rather surprising
that any of them should maintain a consistent
conduct; such is the case, however, with a few, who
are intelligent, exemplary, and highly esteemed;
but the majority bear a very different character, and
pursue a disgraceful course of life.


The influence of all this display of idolatry upon
the nation, argues very little in favour of the moral
advantages of Buddhism. Those who are the most
dishonest in the means they adopt to secure wealth,
are often the most liberal supporters of the priests and
their mummeries. In fact, a blind and nearly equal
reverence for the priests and their idols, and a due
regard to the temporal wants of the former, is too
often the sum and substance of their practical
religion.


The religion of Burmah, Pegu, and Laos, being the
same, the natives of these respective countries who
reside in Siam join in the worship of their masters.


The Chinese have brought their creed and their
idols with them; and here, as at home, they worship
their gods for temporal favours, and express their
reverence only by " sacrificing to their net, and
burning incense to their drag*." Many of them being
Buddhists, they readily unite with the Siamese if
any end is to be gained by doing so.  
  
  
  The Malays practise a species of Islamism, mixed  
  
  
  • Hab. i. 15.
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 200 -->
up, probably, with some of the ancient rites and
customs of their Pagan forefathers. They are
exceedingly noisy in their devotions. At some seasons
whole companies of them spend hours at a time in
trilling out loud and long-drawn cries. The voices
of men and women, of infancy, manhood, and
decrepitude, are mingled in such grating and boisterous
strains as completely to disturb the surrounding
region, and to interrupt the repose of night.


The Portuguese profess a corrupt Catholicism,
which resembles, in many respects, the superstitions
of their Pagan neighbours, and proves quite as inert
in its moral influence. There are about a thousand
of them, who, with one or two respectable exceptions,
are as deeply sunk in mental and moral debasement
as the lowest class of Pagans around them. Destitute
of the force of truth in their creed, of morals in their
practice, of respectability in their character, and even
of pecuniary shew in their external circumstances,
their religion makes little or no progress among their
heathen neighbours.


The deep degradation and scandalous immoralities
of many of them, cast dishonour on the Christian
name, to which they, as well as all their brethren
in the East, most pertinaciously cling.


A person may form some idea of the comparative
reasonableness of these different religions, without
leaving his abode. One night he hears the bells
and drums of Buddhism; the next, the wearisome
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 201 -->
candory cries ofthe Mussulmans; the third, the gong,
drums, and squibs of the Chinese; and the fourth,
the bells, drums, crackers, and guns of the Roman
Catholics, which seem determined to confound the
confusion of them all, and to bear away the inglorious
palm.


It is only very recently that any thing has been
attempted by the Protestant world for the moral
benefit of Siam. The first missionaries who visited
the place belonged to other stations, and went to
Siam unsent by the churches at home. Had it been
left to their tardy operations, the probability is that
thekingdom would still have been supposed
inaccessible, or unimportant as a field for Christian missions.


In the autumn of 1828, Messrs. Gutzlaff and
Tomlin arrived at Siam, and commenced an
interesting series of labours, in the joint capacities of
missionaries and physicians. Their journals are
before the Christian public. Mr. Tomlin was driven
from the place by ill health, after a residence of nine
months, and Mr. Gutzlaff continued the duties ofthe
mission for nearly three years. During this time, the
New Testament, and parts of the Old, were
translated, a vocabulary was formed, and two or three
religious books written. One of the tracts was
printed, and has been circulated. The other works
required revision and correction, and, owing to a
series of obstacles, have not been printed to this day.
Mr. Gutzlaff had also the gratification of baptizing  
  
  
  K 5
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 202 -->
a Chinaman, who had renounced his idols and
heathenish customs, and who, as far as could be judged,
had been made " a partaker of the promise in Christ
by the Gospel."


A few days after the departure of Mr. Gutzlaff for
China, Mr. Tomlin and myself reached the place.
We immediately unpacked our books—the published
tract spoken of, and others in the Chinese language—
opened the medical depository, engaged teachers, and
commenced our labours. These interesting duties
were continued for six months, when my
fellowmissionary was called away to another sphere of
exertion; and I was obliged, from the failure of my
health, to try the effect of change of air and scene.


A narrative of events during this period has been
published. Our time was most actively employed
in labouring, to the extent of our ability, and in
endeavouring to extend that ability. Throngs of patients,
afflicted with almost every kind of disease, daily
applied for relief; and crowds of applicants for books
soon carried away our entire stock. Of the former
number, many were greatly benefited. How far our
spiritual applications were productive of good was
not so easy to ascertain; although we have reason
to believe that our " labours were not in vain in the
Lord."


A few extracts from the journal kept at the time
will give an idea of such facts as were thought worthy
of being recorded.
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 203 -->

Monday afternoon, July 4th, we called, with our
friend Mr. Silveira, on the Prah Kiang, the director
of all the commercial affairs of Bankok, and one of
the principal ministers of state. On our way to his
residence, about two miles from our present abode,
we had the opportunity of seeing a part of the city,
and its suburbs. For a long distance the houses are
built on rafts, on each side ofthe river, and the only
communication is by boats.


The dwellings and shops are constructed of a
slender material, and covered with attap. Skiffs are
employed by the natives for transporting their
persons and light effects. These are so exceedingly
small that their progress is very rapid : the paddler
is obliged to sit in the middle and bottom ofthe boat;
and even then, his life is endangered by the least want
of skill, or agitation ofthe waves*.


The women, like those in China, bear a part in all
kinds of drudgery, and become exceedingly coarse
and immodest in appearance and conversation.


We landed abreast of the Prah Klang's dwelling,
and, not finding him at home, proceeded a short
distance to a pagoda, or rather a suite of buildings,
about which he has been occupied for the last seven
years. The princes and official men generally
expend part of their income in erecting temples and
supporting priests. What a reflection does this cast


* Many of them have been overturned in our sight, and
numbers drowned within a short distance from our cottage.
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 204 -->
upon those who, knowing the true God, and
possessing abundant means for extending that
knowledge, neither make provision for their own eternal
welfare, nor impart their abused privileges to those
who might improve them !


We were apprized of our approach to the presence
of the Prah Kiang by the strange actions of our
interpreter, a Portuguese by extraction, and the only
admitted medium of communication between the great
man and foreigners. When he saw him, though at
the distance of twenty or thirty yards, he bent his
body, and crept along like a sportsman approaching
the game unobserved. In this inclining posture he
continued until within a few yards of the object of
his reverence, when he laid himself prostrate on the
ground, and awaited the pleasure of his superior. We
all approached, and tendered the obeisance required
of foreigners—namely, taking off the hat, bowing,
and sitting in his presence. Except a well-conditioned
body held in an erect posture, while all the workmen
and attendants walked with their heads as near the
ground as possible, there was nothing to distinguish
the old man from the lowest menial in his train. His
person was entirely bare, with the exception of the
cloth usually worn, and there was nothing in the
texture of that to attract our attention.


He made a number of inquiries respecting our
several offices, and especially our object in visiting
Siam; and appeared satisfied when Mr. Tomlin
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 205 -->
mentioned that we came on the same errand which had
brought Mr. Gutzlaff and himself before. But that
our fellow-passenger, Lieut. Daniell, should have
come merely for the benefit of his health, was quite
a paradox to the old man. The visit of a British
officer by no means tended to allay the suspicions
and fears with which the Burmese war had filled
their neighbours. The interview soon closed. The
interpreter was commanded to take us round, and
shew us " the great Babylon" which the old
gentleman was building, part of which he himself
displayed for our admiration.


On Tuesday morning we breakfasted with Mr.
M'Donell, the only European merchant in Siam,
Mr. Hunter being absent; and afterwards went to the
walls of the palace, to see the objects of curiosity
there. Among a number of the largest elephants
we ever saw, were the famed white ones of the king,
supposed to be the habitations of former sovereigns,
and kept with the greatest care. None but the most
honoured and virtuous are thought to be favoured,
after the present existence, with such a rare and
dignified residence. Their hue is far from being white;
it is nearer the colour of cream.


We walked nearly round the palace walls; but
were not allowed to enter. They enclose an
extensive area, and the buildings they contain appear,
judging from the roofs and spires, to be both gaudy
and commodious. We visited a large pagoda,
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 206 -->
surrounded by many smaller apartments and lofty
pillarsSome of the latter were of considerable elevation.
The principal temple was closed, and the priests,
who were lying about on their mats in the other
buildings, shewed no disposition to gratify our
curiosity. One of them, with whom we attempted to
converse on the folly of idol-worship, threatened to
tell the King that we were defaming his gods.


Early in the week we transferred our residence to
the small house allotted to the missionaries by our
hospitable friend. It stands upon poles, beneath
which the waters constantly flow, and, though humble
in appearance and scanty in dimensions, answers
every purpose. Its super-aqueous situation and
numerous crevices render it delightfully airy, and this
is the point of chief importance in the summer of
these tropical regions.


There are many solemn and awakening
considerations suggested by this place. But a few months
since its doors were opened to receive our brother and
sister in this mission : now, the latter lies sleeping
in death, but a short distance from us, and our
fellow-labourer has been called away to other scenes of
exertion. We feel impressed with the admonition,
\"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy
might *." God grant us grace to improve the lesson
of His providence, and to " work while it is day."  
  
  
  25th.—The medical depository has been a scene of  
  
  
  Eccles. ix. lo.
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 207 -->
much activity since our arrival, owing to the
numerous calls for aid. The diseases ofthe natives are
various; many of them brought upon themselves by
their iniquities, and some of a deep and desperate
malignity. Our want of extensive science and
practice, especially as concerns myself, proves rather
inconvenient in cases of a complicated nature; but
our prescriptions are generally, and sometimes
strikingly, made to answer the desired end.


31st.—To-day we had a number of calls, chiefly
for medicine. One of the applicants was a Siamese
of considerable distinction. Another did not come
himself, but sent his servant with a very polite letter.
The former evinced much confidence in our
prescriptions, and could scarcely be prevented from giving ue
a recompence. The chief grounds of our refusal to
accept remuneration for medicines, are the importance
of having this strong argument against the suspicions
of the people, and the unimportance of the sum
which they could or would bestow. The utmost
caution is necessary, to secure the confidence of the
natives; and we know of no better means by which
our motives and object may be known and
commended, than by proving that we act upon such
principles of disinterestedness as they have never
seen exemplified before.


The simplicity of the native character both amuses
and interests us. Even men of some standing in
society evince all the artlessness of children with us.
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 208 -->
They examine with the most minute curiosity the
texture and fashion of our dress, and not
unfrequently extend their scrutiny to the body, proving
with their hands the depth and breadth of the chest,
the appearance of the hands, and arms, and face, and
expressing with the utmost candour, as they proceed,
their admiration or censure. They very often ask
for whatever takes their fancy, though it may be in
use; and if their request is refused, will point, if it be
an article of dress, to other garments, which they
suppose abundantly sufficient for one body, while
they very significantly observe, that the greater part
of their own is not even covered.


Though rather troublesome at present, we are
pleased to find this characteristic so prominent. It
shews us their idea of the superiority of foreigners,
in some respects, at least, and we hope will render
them less tenacious of their religious opinions, when
they find them so totally different from the sentiments
of more polished nations. Some of them display
much affection and gratitude for the medicine and
books. To-day the number of applicants for the
latter has exceeded any thing of the kind we have
yet witnessed : high and low, priests and people,
men and women, old and young, natives and
foreigners, all throng our cottage, and urge their
suit with an eloquence which can scarcely be resisted.
The small number of books, compared with the wants
ofthe people, makes us cautious in their distribution,
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 209 -->
and them earnest in their requests. The novelty of
the thing is, no doubt, the great attraction. Still, we
know that their hearts are in the Lord's hands, and
that the heathen are the purchase and inheritance of
the Saviour.


As the tract, though not clothed in Scripture
phraseology, and not free from errors, is an epitome
of God's word, and illustrates particularly the
redemption of the Saviour, we are encouraged to believe
that it shall produce effect.


August 1st.—Whenever the weather would allow
of it, we have spent an hour or two before breakfast
in teaching the people from house to house. They
listen to the Gospel with attention, and though their
own idolatry is plainly denounced, say nothing in
vindication of it. We daily meet with the very
counterpart of some characters in Gospel lands; men who
will take the subject from your lips, and descant
upon it with eloquence to those around them; but
who evidently know little of its import, and nothing
of its power. Their eloquence is exhausted upon minor
topics, and when reminded of the great mysteries of
the Gospel, the points of difference between
Christianity and the ethics of Confucius, they shew by
their silence that they are quite as ignorant as their
audience.


August 20th.—We have been visited since our
arrival by several of the princes, whose curiosity and
covetousness prove rather troublesome. The most
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 210 -->
interesting character among them makes himself well
known to all visitors, and would, if divested of the
fear of royal displeasure, and rightly guided in his
fondness for foreign customs, become the greatest
blessing to the nation. He is the younger son of
the ex-queen; his elder brother, entitled by birthright
to the throne, in place of the reigning monarch, has
become a priest, by which he is saved the
mortification of bowing down to one whom he is unwilling to
regard as his superior. The title of our visitor is,
\"Lord of Heaven." His age is about thirty-three.
He has acquired a smattering of English; and is one
of the most intelligent, manly, and improvable
characters in the kingdom. He is desirous of obtaining
a correct knowledge of our language, and probably
this is his principal object in visiting us. Our
prayer and aim is, that he may be instructed in the
principles of the Gospel, and brought to a knowledge
of " the truth as it is in Jesus." We are animated
in our exertions by the mere possibility that he may
be preparing to exert an extensive influence in
favour of Christianity—that, perhaps, he may be
kept from the throne, only to fill it in future as " a
nursing father " to the church.


This evening is the fourth in succession that we
have been honoured by the visits of young men in the
higher walks of life. One of them was a prince, to
whom Mr. Tomlin had given an English Bible when
at Siam before. He has a peculiarly amiable
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 211 -->
countenance, and fascinating demeanour; but, like all his
countrymen, is as inquisitive as a child in examining
every foreign trifle that catches his eye. He took
the last bound volume on our table, and left upon
our minds an impressive concern for his everlasting
welfare.


Two of the Prah Klang's sons, with their suite,
spent last evening with us. The elder is an intelligent
and engaging youth, who exerts a powerful influence
for one of his age, and is probably destined to make
a conspicuous figure on the political arena of Siam.
From his inquiries about the book we had been
distributing, whether it was written and printed by
natives, and, if not, who it was that had taught
foreigners the language, we thought we saw
symptoms of alarm or suspicion, which were probably
infused by the old man who sent him. We gave
him an unbound volume of the book about which
he inquired, assured that he could find nothing
exceptionable in it, and hoping that he might be led
to examine it with more attention and profit than to
find out the when, the where, and the how, of its
production.


August 22d.—An event occurred to-day, which
we earnestly pray may be repeated, until the whole
kingdom is converted to Christ. A priest, of very
respectable appearance, sent a messenger before him,
to inform us that he had read our book with
approbation, and, being unable to comprehend some of its
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 212 -->
doctrines, would be happy to receive from our lips a
solution of his difficulties. He waited at a short
distance from the house, until the messenger returned
to him with a favourable answer. He remained a
long time, and plied us with such questions as
convinced us that he had thought deeply on the subject.
The Saviour of sinners was the burden of his
inquiries—who He was—what was the distinction
between him and the Father—whether his love
extended to men of all nations—how he expiated the
sins ofthe guilty—and whether God the Father bore
an equal affection tothe world.


He was particular in inquiring about the nature of
sin, the process by which the heart could be
sanctified, and the manner of Divine worship. Many
points of minor importance were proposed, and a
number of his own opinions submitted to the test
of our faith. Such was the earnestness of the man,
that when he thought his questions not perfectly
understood, he would turn to a Chinese youth in his
train, and beg him to put the inquiry in Chinese. It
afforded an opportunity for preaching the Gospel with
apparent advantage,and many most important ideas
were suggested to his inquiring mind.


September 10th.—Three priests of distinction spent
part ofthe evening with us. With the fears, probably,
though evidently not with the object, of Nicodemus,
they came " by night." They had been before, and
had greatly interested us by their mild and friendly
<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 213 -->
demeanour. Of Jesus and his religion they always
speak with approbation, though, we fear, not always
with sincerity. It is delightful to think that His
blessed name, and some knowledge of his character
and offices, are becoming familiar to these deluded
men. It is by no means uncommon for us to be
saluted by the title of disciples of Jesus,—often with
an encomium upon the gracious Being whom we
serve. The folly and consequences of idol worship
were plainly pointed out to-night, and the unpublished
portion of Scripture, containing the sermon on the
mount, given to one of them to read aloud.


That their own religion sits lightly upon many of
them, is evident from numerous facts. Some of them
do not hesitate to eat, and even to ask us for, articles
strictly prohibited by their laws. Though not allowed
to partake of any thing after the mid-day meal, two
of our visitors had infringed the rules before, and
were only waiting to-night for the assent of their
superior.


The priests have hitherto constituted a large
proportion of our visitors. Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
have applied for books and medicines, and not a few
of them have become very sociable, and frequently
spend part of the day, or evening, with us. They
express no aversion to the dissemination of a faith
which they might know is both opposed to, and
destructive of, their own. Many of them, there is
every reason to beUeve, care nothing about their own
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 214 -->
religion, and know as little about ours. Not
expecting to remain in these monasteries beyond their term
of pupilage, they appear to feel themselves quite as
much at liberty to gratify their curiosity, as to
sacrifice it to an object in which they have no permanent
interest. Selected from all classes of society, and
destined to fill all stations in public life—having
abundant leisure to read, and seemingly desirous to
learn the contents of our little volume—we should be
callous indeed, if our hearts did not often melt in
sorrow for their blindness, and prompt the most
fervent intercessions on their behalf.


Our most frequent visitor was introduced to us by
a note from Mr. Gutzlaff, in which he is recommended
as " a friend of truth, thoroughly versed in the
doctrines of Buddhism, humble and docile, a chaplain to
his Majesty." He is far above the standard of his
countrymen, and one of the finest models of
unchristianized men we ever saw. He evinces nothing of
the idle curiosity of his countrymen; but is fond of
science, and particularly anxious to learn the habits,
languages, and religions of other nations. He comes
often for instruction, and proves himself an apt and
assiduous scholar. There is something more than
ordinarily engaging in his countenance and
deportment; and the knowledge he has acquired of
Christianity, and the apparent candour with which he speaks
of the gracious Redeemer, render ten-fold more
deplorable his remaining darkness and fears. At hi?
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 215 -->
first visit we gave him the manuscript Life of Jesus,
which he read; since then he has taken different parts
of the unpublished Gospels for perusal.


September 19th.—We spent part of the afternoon
and dined in company with one of the Cambojian
princes. He was anxious to see the style and taste the
dishes of a European dinner, and Mr. Silveira very
obligingly gratified him. About twenty years ago his
elder brother and himself fled from their own country,
owing to some disturbances, and placed themselves
under the protection of the king of Siam. Since then,
the king of Cambodjia, their father, has died, and
though the brother was the lawful heir to the throne,
their patron has sternly refused them the liberty of
returning home. A brother, younger than either of
those in Siam, has obtained the crown.


This prince, though among the most intellectual
in the kingdom, has still all the curiosity of the most
ignorant. Much of his time, in the company of
foreigners, is employed in making familiar and ludicrous
remarks to his attendants. These generally spread
themselves on the floor, according to an order which
appears to exist among them, and as near his chair as
possible. Whatever strikes the prince as peculiarly
good or offensive, he hesitates not to pass to his
prostrate train for examination and remark.


The two most important facts we have gathered
today, are, that the population of Cambodjia is equal to
more than half that of Siam, and that there are no
<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 216 -->
Romish priests to oppose the introduction of pure
religion. As far as we have ascertained, a few
catechists are all that the Roman Catholics have been
able or willing to furnish to their proselytes in that
country, although the priests from Cochin-China and
Siam occasionally pay them a visit.


There is every reason to believe that a Protestant
mission might be planted in Cambodjia. The best
situation would probably be near one of the mouths of
its famous river, or perhaps in the vicinity of some of
the settlements of Malays, Chinese, or Japanese, who
have emigrated to that country. An annual trading
vessel visiting the place would be of double utility
—rendering an acceptable service to the missionaries,
and improving, by its traffic, the secular condition of
the people. Here again we must look to the " ships
of Tarshish " for those preparatory services, and that
co-operation, by which we believe that the Saviour's
reign on earth is to be hastened.


October 22d, 1831.—The present month is one of
special interest to the Siamese. The priests are kept
more employed at their solemnities now than at any
other time, and the whole nation, including the king,
shew more than a usual devotion to their idols.
Offerings are made to the river, for its use and abuse
during the year. A part of their ceremonies, if
indeed they possess a religious character, consists in
illuminations and fireworks.  
  
  
  Last night we took a boat, and went to the palace,
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 217 -->
to witness an exhibition in which the monarch
himself takes an active part. The current, which at this
season runs usually at the rate of four or five miles
an hour, delayed us some time on the way, and we
availed ourselves of every course in which its strength
could be avoided. Part of the way we passed among
boats moored near the shore; part, between floating
houses and the land; and part, through small creeks
or canals, which run nearly parallel with the river.
This afforded another opportunity of seeing the
style in which multitudes are obliged, and apparently
contented, to live. The contrast is striking, between
the small and well-peopled huts of the common classes,
and the spacious grounds and buildings of some of
the princes. These last occupy the best situations
on shore, and are generally grouped with temples;
and the dwellings of priests who are supported at
their expense.


We passed the Prah Kiang, sitting in one of the
floating houses, and amusing himself with firing
squibs in the water. The number and variety of small
boats before the palace did not equal our
expectations. As a mark of respect, we were all obliged to
keep on the opposite side of the river, whence the
person of the king could not be distinguished. We
waited till near midnight, before a lamp was lighted
at tbe palace. A discharge of fire-works was then
heard, and two large vessels, on either side of the
King's watering-house, were lighted up with lamps.  
  
  
  L
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 218 -->
Then a number of small boats were richly illuminated,
and sent down the tide. After which, rockets, and a
few inferior exhibitions of fire-works, were presented.


The full-orbed moon riding in silent majesty above
our heads, and shedding a lovely radiance over the
scene, repaid us richly for the beauties which her
lustre had eclipsed.


November 8th.—For some days the King has been
visiting the pagodas supported by himself, and
furnishing the priests with such articles of necessity and
luxury as his zeal and bounty prompt him to bestow.
This work is considered highly meritorious, and is
performed annually at this season. The temples built
and supplied from the King's treasury are numerous,
amounting to between twenty and thirty, and many
days are usually expended in completing the round.
The principal priest of each temple is arrayed on
these occasions by the hand of his royal master—the
priest, according to the humble profession of the
monarch, being the superior.


To-day the procession passed our house. It
consisted of about a hundred barges, many of them
more elegant than any thing* of the kind I had ever
beheld. The guard-boats—a splendid array—led the
van. Some of them were so long and narrow, and
so well manned, that they seemed almost to fly;
though the slightest inclination, it was evident,
would plunge their contents into the wave beneath
them. Others, of more substantial material and
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 219 -->
larger dimensions, carried pieces of ordnance on
pivots, and were managed by soldiers dressed in a
flaming uniform.


The King's galley followed, said to be at least one
hundred and twenty feet in length, and propelled by
eighty men. A curve at the bow and stem raises it
some distance above the surface of the water, and
adds much to the elegance of its structure. It is
made of one tree, and many lives were sacrificed in
transferring it from its native place hither. This,
however, is no consideration with the Siamese. It is
by no means uncommon for numbers to perish in
conveying the kings, or men of authority, on
expeditions of importance. Excessive toil, an exhausting
climate, and want of relief—the boats being too
narrow to carry more than one set of hands—soon
produce fatal consequences to the unpitied boatmen.


His majesty's portly person had no other covering
than a cloth about the loins : he was attended by a
few of the women and children of his large family.
The boats of the princes followed, many of them but
little inferior to the king's, and all with horses' tails,
the insignia of their rank, suspended from the bow.
The procession was closed by the barges of persons
of less importance, and the whole was probably more
than a mile in extent. We were obliged, at the
command of a fore-runner, to shut the door—a
ceremony expected from every one before whose house
such a sacred personage passes. The length of the  
  
  
  l2
<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 220 -->
array, the great diversity of boats, the unanimous
shouts bursting from so many lips, the noise of
those who beat time, with the uniform motions of
the paddles, and the rapidity with which the pageant
hastened by, rendered the scene as lively to the
senses, as its object was sickening to the mind of the
Christian beholder. How dreadful is the influence
of the great deceiver over this nation, summoning
thousands of the pride and power of the kingdom to
one feat of idolatry !


December lst.—For about two months the Meinam
has overflowed its banks, and laid the surrounding
country under water. It is said not to have equalled
its present height for the last thirty years. This
morning we took a boat, and steered for the fields
where vve had repeatedly walked, expecting to see
one liquid expanse unbroken save by the trees and
scattered houses. We were disappointed; for though
we proceeded some distance, and might have gone as
much further as we pleased, the luxuriant rice had so
far overtopped the level of the water, that at a little
distance the latter was not perceptible. The labourers
were moving about in boats, cutting the paddy, and
attending to other business. The country for an
immense distance is nearly a dead level, and so
general is the present flood, that it is said you can
leave the channel of the river and make a straight
course to Juthia, the ancient capital, about a
hundred miles distant.
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 221 -->

That there would be some obstruction from the
tops of the paddy, appears very evident to us, unless
the soil is more depressed, or less productive, above
Bankok, than in its immediate vicinity. The houses
built upon rafts have greatly the advantage at present.
In many of the others the water is so deep that
their occupants are obliged to erect platforms above
the floor upon which to sit and sleep. It is a time
of suffering to the poor, many of whom have made
no provision for this exigence, and are obliged to
throw themselves upon the charities of a heartless
people.


December6th.—About a fortnight ago a Chinese boy
appeared before our door, and, being friendless, poor,
and ill, entreated us to take him in. His case excited
our pity, and we could not refuse. His employment
had been suspended on account of the overflowing of
the waters, and no man would receive him. While
in prosperity, there is no want of relatives and friends;
but when an appeal is made to their pity, it is of
little avail. The cruelty, of the Chinese especially,
is quite unnatural. They have sometimes brought
their sick, reduced to the last extremity of disease,
and, after laying them before the door, endeavoured
to make their escape unobserved, glad to get rid of
the incumbrance, and careless of the consequences.
The boy lingered till Sunday, when he was found
dead on the steps leading to his door. He had
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 222 -->
probably felt a sense of suffocation, and died in the
attempt to get into the air.


There was something very affecting in his case.
Of six of the dialects spoken in the empire, and
employed more or less by those who are found in
these parts, his was the only one of which neither our
teachers nor ourselves knew anything. We had both
been labouring, the very day of his death, to
communicate some idea of spiritual things to his mind,
but without effect. Oh how impressive the call that
seems to sound from the clay, which its immortal
tenant in deep ignorance has just left!


December 25th (Sabbath).—Besides the small band,
consisting of only four or six, who usually worship
with us, there were two strangers present this morning.
They had called for medicines before, and from their
willingness to listen to the doctrines of salvation, and
a partial knowledge of these doctrines previously
obtained, much interest was excited on their behalf.
One of them mentioned, a few days ago, that he had
known the God of heaven for a number of years,
but had never seen the " sacred books,"—a very
imperfect acquaintance doubtless. The other said that
his neighbours came to his house to worship the true
God with him; but here again we cannot but suspect
a near approach to heathenism, both in their ideas of
the Lord and in the manner of their worship.  
  
  
  They appear, however, like those who are " feeling
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 223 -->
after the Lord," and we earnestly hope that He may
be found of them. There is something so peculiar
in their case that we are encouraged to believe that
an Invisible Hand is leading them " out of darkness
into marvellous light."


27th.—To-day we saw an instance of heathen
cruelty. The skiff of a lad was upset a short
distance from the shore. He clung to the boat, and
begged the assistance of two men who were
passing by. They passed within a few feet of him,
and paid no attention to his request. He was carried
about half a mile, with a strong current, and, though
others approached very near, none would stop to
rescue him. When I saw him last he was labouring
with his feet and paddle to get his boat to shore. I
asked the inhuman men the cause of their cruelty.
Some made no reply. One answered, in a tone of
excitement, " He did not call;" though he evidently
knew not, if he even turned to see, whether the lad
was not too much exhausted for the exertion. Though
this instance is the first of the kind I have seen, it is
by no means uncommon. Mr. Tomlin says they
have sometimes been obliged to hire them to rescue
their suffering fellow-men from imminent danger.
A trifling sum will move them, when no appeal to
their pity can. What a blessing is the Gospel, in its
meliorating influences upon the character osman !


Another event, which evinces the patriotism,
perhaps the cruelty, of a Brutus, has recently occurred.
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 224 -->
The King was informed that his son, the heir
apparent to the throne, was in the habit of smoking opium.
He immediately commanded his property to be sold,
and himself to be arrested and imprisoned for
execution. The mother interceded in vain. The other
princes, and the men in authority, exerted their
influence in behalf of the youth, with no better effect.
The second King, though very ill, finding that the
prince was about to suffer a cruel death for a common
crime, was conveyed to the palace, and succeeded in
averting the threatened doom. The circumstance
has produced considerable excitement, and may tend
in a measure to prevent the prevalence of a ruinous
vice.


December 29th.—To-day we have been cheered by
some pleasing facts, which render it evident that the
seed sown in this wilderness begins to appear. The
two persons mentioned as the increase to the usual
number of Sabbath worshippers, came again to-day.
One of them had had his head cut by a stone thrown
at him while these two and a friend were convened for
reading the Scriptures and prayer. The house, they
say, was assailed by a number of Siamese, who
probably were offended at their departure from the
heathenish customs of their neighbours. They were
informed of the sufferings often endured by God's
children for the same cause, and they manifested no
disposition to flinch from their newly commenced
duties.
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 225 -->

In visiting a sick man, who is in a shocking state
of disease, we found that he knew something of the
Lord, and professed to worship Him alone. He was
too weak to read himself, but a neighbour had come in,
and read the Christian tract to him. This neighbour
had been employed by us as a carpenter, and
manifested much intelligence and interest in his inquiries
about the Christian religion. Yesterday he was
instructed, at his own request, in the nature of prayer—
a subject upon which their previous notions render
the nation absurdly ignorant.


My teacher, whose own heart is like the nether
millstone, mentioned the case of a man who came
to see him, after the business ofthe day, to have the
sacred books explained. He said that the man had
no idea how the Lord of heaven should be
worshipped, and, when informed of our Sabbath services,
asked whether he might attend.


Another striking case occurred in the dispensary
to-day. While a lad was employed in reading part
of a Siamese tract, another, of about eight or nine
years of age, who sat near, repeated some of it before
him. I asked him how he knew it: he replied, that
his father and mother had taught him; that they
read the Christian tract every day, and worshipped
the Lord of heaven. That there is some truth in this,
is evident from his own knowledge.


Thus the Lord shews us that our labours are not
in vain, just at the time when my companion isleavU
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 226 -->
ing the place, and my own health has become so
much impaired as to unfit me in a great measure for
exertion, and to render a change desirable, if not
necessary. Oh that this, and every other heathen
station, were occupied by numbers, that, when some
are compelled to retire, others might remain to carry
on the work !


January 2d, 1832.—The priest who was at first
introduced to us by letter, and who has called repeatedly
since, came this evening with another, who had also
visited us previously. They had heard, before entering
the house, that we were both going, and appeared
more than usually affectionate. We spent all the
evening in endeavouring to persuade them to " turn
from idols to the only living and true God." They
listened with attention; asked many questions—one of
which was, whether God disallowed of idol worship—
and appeared more solemn than we had ever seen
them before. The superior has a mind of ready and
comprehensive powers. He has nearly copied out
two of the Gospels, and generally understands what
he reads. He spoke of the fig-tree which Jesus cursed,
and we endeavoured to enforce its application upon
himself. We have reason to believe that he is
convinced of the folly of idolatry, and impressed in some
degree with the reasonableness, if not the necessity,
ofthe Christian religion. But his rank is high, and
the consequences of changing his faith, which his  
  
  
  grasping mind no doubt fully apprehends, will
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 227 -->
probably produce a struggle of soul, before he is made
to submit. His plea for not being a Christian is
ignorance. He says he knows but little yet. May
\"the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom,"
embolden him to profess Christ before his perishing
countrymen.


January.—There is something in the beauty of the
heavens at this season of the year, which makes up
for the destitution of every earthly charm, and
exceeds any thing I ever noticed in other climates.
For many weeks there has scarcely fallen a drop of
rain. The atmosphere during the day is so clear,
that the eye wanders through the boundless field of
vision with a most animating gaze. Nothing can
exceed the glories ofthe morning and evening twilight.
The burnished heavens—the broad rays of the hidden
sun, shooting up the wide arch of the firmament—
often succeeded by transverse streaks of the most
delicate and varying colours, and these again yielding
to a thousand softer and still softer tinges—hold our
eyes and hearts, at the close of each day, in glowing
admiration, until the stars have one by one unveiled
their glories, and all the celestial worlds beam forth
through the vaulted azure with the brightest radiance.
Between the rains and the commencement of the hot
weather—a period of about three months—the climate
is delightfully temperate. The summer commences
very early, and the heat is often intense before the
rainy season begins.
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 228 -->

January 5th.—As we passed up the river this
morning, the gilded temples and spires of idolatry
gleamed in the first rays of the rising sun, and shed
a lustre on the scene around them. Crowds of priests
were passing to and fro; while women, with large
vessels of boiled rice, and other provisions, were
sitting before the doors of the floating houses, or in
their boats, measuring to each his allowance. This
finished, they put both hands to their forehead—by
which gesture they worship their idols—while the
priest does not vouchsafe any recognition of their
reverence. We called upon a man in office, and were
informed that the King is preparing to consecrate
eight new and newly repaired temples. On this
occasion he throws away a vast sum of money in
support of his royal dignity. A fixed estimate is
placed upon his person, his palace, some of his wives,
his sons, his plate, and other articles. Each distinct
sum is written on a scrap of paper, and put within a
lemon. Some of them amount to one thousand
dollars a piece. His Majesty ascends an elevated place,
and scatters these lemons among the assembled crowd;
and those who get them receive their respective sums
upon presenting the paper. Thus, like the afflicted at
the pool of Bethesda, the most needy are thrust aside,
while the more vigorous and less miserable come
forward and divide the spoil.


We passed a funeral procession. The body was
placed in a coffin shaded by a large canopy. From
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 229 -->
the coffin a piece of white cloth was passed over the
shoulder of a lad dressed to represent an angel, and
fastened to the garment of a priest sitting near the
bow of the boat. By this means they say the priest
conducts the deceased to happiness. The body is
then taken to a temple, and burned, according to the
custom of the country.


Before returning, we called at two of the most
spacious and magnificent pagodas in the city. The
superiority of one of them consists in the situation and
arrangement of its buildings; of the other, in their
multiplicity and magnificence. In entering the
outer court of the latter, our attention was first
arrested by large images, more like horses than any
other animals, and occupying the place of warders.
All the gates are guarded by these, and another set
of still stranger figures, intended to represent the
body ofa man with a face of mixed features—a
combination of man, beast, and bird—all distorted, and
giving the countenance a hideous expression. Within
this outer court are a large temple and oratory,
where the priests deliver their discourses; two or
three high towers; and an extensive row of open
buildings. Having passed through the court, we
entered a second gate, and found a more spacious area,
surrounded by wall and corridors, and embellished
with spires of still larger dimensions.


In the centre there is a stupendous mass of
irregular buildings, having temples on four sides
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 230 -->
facing the area, opposite each other, and connected
by smaller ranges. We entered one of the large
temples, desirous, if possible, of passing through and
examining the interior. A number of priests were
stretched upon their beds, sleeping; others were
whiling away the time at trifling employments, while
before them and a large idol—objects of nearly equal
reverence—women were worshipping. Again our
irreverence was the subject of inquiry, and again
we pointed to Him who had denounced such
abominations, and who alone is to be worshipped.
Some were silent and sullen, and refused to open
the inner door. One, who had perhaps received
a ray of true light, helped ns in explaining our
message. After nearly compassing the buildings,
which proved no inconsiderable walk, we found an
open door, and entered. The whole outer range,
round which we had thus passed, with another of
nearly equal extent a few feet within, was completely
filled with rows of gilded images, of different sizes,
and in different altitudes. The number of idols
was variously stated by the priests. Our own
calculation made the aggregate between six and
seven hundred, though we could not have seen them
all, and none of the natives would admit that there
were less than a thousand. The largest image was
upwards of thirty-five feet high. Enclosed by these
ranges of buildings we found another court,
containing a number of tasteful ornaments, of a pyramidal
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 231 -->
form, and with a splendid temple in the centre. Had
"Holiness to the Lord," been inscribed here, this
inner temple, as guarded as the " sanctum sanctorum,"
would have appeared more beautiful than any thing
ofthe kind we had ever seen.


While our eyes were employed in examining these
objects of admiration and horror, our tongues were
busy in argument with the priests and others who
followed us. The longest discussion took place in
presence of the largest idol, with two young men,
who were more zealous for the honour of their gods
than any we had before met. One of them insisted
that the image could speak; for, pointing to a large
tablet before him, he said, " All this was dictated by
him." The other, retorting our exposure of their
folly, scornfully represented the cross with his fingers;
believing that all foreigners were Roman Catholic
idolaters, and plainly shewing that Papal
abominations had proved an offence even to these ignorant
heathen. We were assisted in correcting this mistake
—alas ! too common among the ignorant!—by an
intelligent-looking man of middle age, who had
evidently received and been impressed by some correct
knowledge of Christianity—probably from the books
—and who aided us in our arguments with much
apparent interest.


In some of their temples there is a great display
of paintings, and the subjects brought together shew
the extreme ignorance and depravity of the nation.
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 232 -->
The walls of one of them which I visited, were
completely covered with representations of heaven,
earth, hell, and one ofthe stars of which their books
speak. There were angels, men, and monkeys—
foreigners, or caricatures of white men, and dignified
natives—temples and brothels—scenes of gaiety and
sadness, of peace and war, by land and sea—with
almost every sketch which could be framed from their
sacred books, or conceived by their versatile limners.
Such another chamber of imagery I never beheld.
The prince, my informant, remarked, that the object
of these paintings was to instruct the illiterate
through the medium of their senses. How far he
is indebted to some of his friends for this truly Papal
apology, I know not; but that he is familiar with
many of the notions of the Romish church is quite
evident. One day he pointed to a tower attached to
a temple, and inquired if I knew what was deposited
there. I told him that I had heard that some of them
contained money. He replied, " Not money, but
the bones of God." I asked him how that was
possible, for God has no body, and a Spirit has no
bones. He answered, "The Roman Catholics speak
of the bones of God/' I told him that the Roman
Catholics in these countries were very ignorant; but not
quite so ignorant as to speak of preserving the bones
of God—they must have meant the bones of good
men. " Oh yes," said he; "I mean the same thing;
these are the bones of good men." I am not certain
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 233 -->
but that my apology was unwarranted, for their saints
hold the same place, and receive the same honours,
as the gods ofthe heathen.


The journal of our first visit to Siam closes here.
The greater part of the occurrences recorded at the
time have been omitted : enough has been extracted
to present, to those who have not read the journal,
some glimpses of Siam and her population, as well as
some idea of the means employed to raise them in the
scale of human and responsible beings. The most
important inquiry remains tobe answered—viz. What
has been the result of these exertions and favourable
appearances? how many "have turned to God from
idols, to serve the living and true God, and to wait
for His Son from heaven ? " We answer : We know
not that this has been the case with any—the time
has been too short to form an opinion. A heathen's
mind cannot be enlightened in a day, neither is it
reasonable to suppose that his heart will be renovated
until his judgment is informed. The means which
ordinarily lead to this result have not been employed.
We have done little more than scatter the good seed,
and that upon ground loaded with noxious weeds,
without having had time to witness its springing up,
still less to cherish it into lively strength.


And here it may not be out of place to caution the
reader against those favourable, though false,
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 234 -->
conelusions, which are too frequently deduced from
missionary journals. The difficulty of writing so as to
inform the Christian world of actual occurrences, and
yet not to sacrifice a faithful report to the dreaded evils
of misinterpretation, must be felt by every missionary.
The song of the ploughman and the sower, especially
when he expresses the joyous expectation of the
harvest, is confounded with the shouts of the reaper; and
then, when the mistake is discovered, the labourer, and
not the listener, is blamed. We do not say that no
misconceptions have been transferred from the mind
of the sanguine reporter to his reader; but, in the
great majority of cases where mistakes exist, we
believe them to originate with the latter. For instance,
when we speak of the avidity with which the heathen
receive Christian books, the best motive is charitably
assigned, when they may have been artfully
concealing the very worst. When their conversation is
detailed, they receive credit for a certain amount of
knowledge, which among Christians is connected
with the sentiments they express, but which their
future lives prove they do not possess. They are
believed sincere, when they neither feel what they
say nor know that the truths they profess should
influence the heart. Their own views and notions
of every thing sacred are so opposite to ours, that,
without much experience, and severe scrutiny, we
cannot determine the standard by which to try them;
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 235 -->
and even with this intimate acquaintance with their
modes of thought, there is constant danger of being
deceived, through the hypocrisy of some and the
self-ignorance of others.


In our excursions abroad, and in their visits to us,
we have met with numbers who evinced a superficial
knowledge of the contents of the book we had
distributed. A few seemed to manifest some
impression of the truth upon their hearts. We have had
pleasing evidence that the spirit of inquiry was
abroad; but there were no grounds of certainty for
concluding that any had been " renewed in the spirit
of their minds."
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 236 -->
  
  CHAPTER XI.  
  
  
  PASSAGE TO SINGAPORE AND MALACCA.

January 14, 1832.—Soon after midnight, on Friday
last, we left Bankok, and proceeded in a barge to
Paknam, where the brig Sebastian was lying. Capt.
{empty}D. L. Shawhad insisted upon our taking a passage with
him, for which he refused all compensation. Messrs.
Hunter and M'Donald, by whom the ship was
chartered, the only Europeans in the place, were among
our fellow-passengers. We reached the brig early on
Saturday morning, and immediately weighed anchor.
In passing over the bar at the mouth of the Meinam,
the sounding line gave just as much water as the
vessel drew; yet nothing occurred to impede our
progress, and in a few hours we were ploughing our
way down the Gulf of Siam. With a leading wind
almost the whole of the passage, and without obstacle,
apparent danger, or peculiarity of any kind, we
reached Singapore yesterday (Friday) morning. I
took up my abode with Mr. Thomsen, and Mr.
Tomlin proceeded to Malacca, where Mrs. T. is
residing.  
  
  
  Singapore is an important missionary station. It
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 237 -->
contains a population of about twenty-one thousand
souls, of whom upwards of eight thousand are
Chinese, and seven thousand Malays. But its
greatest value consists in its relative advantages.
There is no other mart of commerce so much
frequented by native vessels from the different
kingdoms and islands of South-Eastern Asia. China,
Cochin-China, Cambodjia, Siam, the Malayan
Peninsula, on the continent; and Sumatra, Java, Borneo,
Celebes, Bali, Manilla, besides many other islands
farther East, and numerous other places of less
importance, in all the neighbouring settlements of the
Straits; send forth their yearly fleets to this free port,
and return to their respective places loaded with the
comforts, the luxuries, the drugs, and the dregs of
civilized nations. Many of these proas are from places
which have never been frequented by Europeans, and
where there might be much hazard in venturing.


How important is it that this fountain of commerce
should be supplied with " the water of life," and
made to send forth its rich streams into the different
and distant tracts of heathenism with which it
communicates !


But, hke the other stations beyond the Ganges,
Singapore has received very little attention from
Christian Societies at home. Mr. Thomsen is the
only missionary at present in the place. Being
laboriously engaged in the work of translation and
printing—the primary and most indispensable
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 238 -->
business of a missionary—and enervated, almost
exhausted, by the ravages ofa protracted illness—he has
but little time and strength to attend to the external
duties of the station. There is not at present on the
island a missionary to the Chinese. Singapore
demands the labours of at least four men. The Chinese
alone would tax the energies of one missionary; two
should be constantly engaged in supplying the
different native vessels with Christian books, and in
visiting the numerous native villages on the
surrounding islands; and one would find abundant
occupation in his study, and at the press. Availing
themselves of the influence of some of the merchants,
and of pecuniary pledges, by which the late Mr.
Dalton was secured, missionaries might make
excursions to some of the most populous and benighted
islands in the Archipelago. The usefulness of such
men would be proportioned to their faith and
enterprising spirit.


Singapore is the great factory of Malayan
publications, and the depot of Christian books, in the
common languages of the Straits and neighbouring
islands. Mr. Thomsen has nearly completed an
improved version of the Malayan New Testament,
which will soon be ready to take the place of the
old edition, prepared by the early Dutch chaplains.
Considering the poverty of the language, and the
many disadvantages under which the translation was
made, the old version is a work of much merit; still
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 239 -->
it contains words and phrases unintelligible to tho
reader who understands neither the Arabic
vocabulary nor the Bible idiom. Besides this important
work, which is now partially printed, a number of
others have issued from the same press, and been
extensively circulated. There are at present three
Chinese schools here, under the superintendence of
Miss Martyn. The little comparative stress laid upon
the mere acquisition ofthe Chinese characters, as well
as the pains taken to illustrate the ideas they convey
in the mother-tongue of the children *, is highly
commendable, and worthy of universal imitation. A
desire of acquiring the language is their only
inducement to attend; but, as the books employed are all
adapted to convey a far more important knowledge,
the great object of the teachers may be readily gained
without interfering with that of the parents and
children.


There were formerly two or three Malay schools,
under the superintendence of Mrs. Thomsen; but a
want of health sufficient to contend with the
embarrassments which indifference, indolence, and
Mahommedanism combined to produce, have obliged
her to discontinue her labours for the present.


The good which might be effected in Singapore
by education, is incalculable. It requires, it is
true, much zeal, self-denial, and perseverance in the  
  
  
  * The mothers are Malays, (he fathers Chinese.
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 240 -->
teachers; but if there were those who gave their sole
attention to the schools, the obstacles which now
exist would gradually yield, until the task became
comparatively easy. This sphere is peculiarly well
adapted for ladies. A number of girls' and
infantschools might be established with great advantage to
children, parents, and society at large.


The European population of Singapore are greatly
favoured in the faithful preaching of one who has
their eternal welfare at heart, and whose prayers,
counsels, purse, heart, and hands, are devoted to
every cause that glorifies his Lord*.


January 29th.—We determined to spend part of
yesterday among the Chinese, Malays, and others in
the town. The employment was very animating.
We soon separated—Mr. Thomsen took the Malays
and Kalings, and I the Chinese. Wherever we
stopped, numbers gathered round us, listened to our
remarks, and received our books with the utmost
readiness. They even came to the door of the
carriage to solicit tracts, when they were all disposed
of, and we were about returning home


February 26th.—This morning vve took a number
of books, in three of the languages most current in
the Straits, and visited the southern and western
shores of Singapore island. We passed on the way
a number of boats covered with small mats, and  
  
  
  * The Rev. R. Burn, since deceased.
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 241 -->
inhabited by a race of people who prefer these confined
prisons to a residence on land. As their mode of
life is the same as that of those who dwell on the
waters in China, and tradition says that the latter
are emigrants from some external country, it is
possible that they and the Orang Laut, as these are called,
may have had a common origin. They live almost
as irrationally and slothfully as the indolent tribes of
beasts around them : every movement seems dictated
by the necessities of the day.


We found a very thinly scattered population on
shore, scarcely any of whom were capable of reading.
They had lately caught two or three tigers, ofa huge
size and terrific appearance. Their trap is a large
hole, which they fill with water, and then cover it
over with brush. A dog is fastened to the centre of
a narrow board, which passes over the pit, and is
made of such frail materials, that when the ravenous
animal leaps upon his prey, there is nothing to
support him, and he sinks into the water beneath. In
some places the country had been cleared and
entirely deserted. After forming a settlement, by
removing all the thick underwood and planting
fruittrees, isa sudden death, or something a little
uncommon, occurs, they imagine that the place is infested
by a malicious spirit, and immediately leave it. We
found a few Chinese scattered about, where there
were any means of making money, and to them, and
to all who could read, we gave books.  
  
  
  M
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 242 -->

March 6th (Tuesday).—I left Singapore for
Malacca on Saturday, in one of the small vessels which
ply between the two places. I was the only foreigner
among a crew and cargo of Chinese and natives of
the country. The place assigned for European
passengers was so low, and so crammed with goods, that
I was obliged to creep into it; and then the only choice
of posture was between lying and sitting. There was,
however, a free current of air, which is far more
important in these hot regions than all other external
comforts. Had the breeze with which we started
continued, twenty-four hours would have completed
our passage, but as we were becalmed through the
greater part of the day, we did not arrive until
Monday morning. The number of Chinese on board
afforded free exercise for my stammering tongue, and
rendered the voyage a season of instruction, at least
to a few of them.


The town of Malacca has a rural aspect from the
offing. It stands on a plain, with numerous trees
interspersed among the houses, though without any
striking feature. The most commanding object in
the vicinity, is the ruins of a large Romish church,
founded by Francis Xavier, which occupies the
principal elevation near the shore. There is a small
light-house and telegraphic apparatus upon the same
site. The interior of the country is diversified with
a few hills, and a range of distant mountains bounds
the prospect.
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 243 -->

The place is rendered sacred by the early death of
two most useful missionaries. Milne and Collie are
names which will ever be remembered among the
most distinguished benefactors of China. Though
their career was brief, their labours were arduous,
and the works they have written and translated into
the Chinese language are among the means by which
the regeneration of that empire may be effected.
Mr. Hughes is now the only missionary at the station.
Mr. Tomlin returned with me from Siam, to take the
superintendence of the college; Mr. Kidd, the
principal, having been obliged to return to Europe for the
benefit of his health.


March 9th.—Malacca boasts a healthful climate,
interesting scenery, and pleasant roads. The
principal drive for exercise, is round a large Chinese
cemetery, which stretches over an irregular surface
of ground, and encloses two or three miles within its
limits. Some of the tombs are extensive and
ornamental. There are one or two retreats a few miles
from the town, along the sea shore, to which the
residents resort for relaxation from duty, and bodily
recreation.


This evening I attended a religious meeting in one
of the Chinese schools. The service was conducted
as in similar meetings in Christian lands, and
consisted of prayer, singing, reading, and exhortation.
More than a dozen Chinamen were present, who
seemed attentive. The place, object, worshippers,  
  
  
  m 2
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 244 -->
and especially the season, a week-day evening,
imparted a peculiar interest to the occasion. Oh how
animating is the prospect that the Lord shall be
worshipped in heathen as in Christian lands! still
more delightful, that " His will shall be done in
earth, as it is in heaven."


March 12th.—The Anglo-Chinese college in this
place was instituted for the purpose of qualifying
young men to become teachers to their countrymen,
with the earnest hope that the " God of all grace "
would sanctify their talents to himself. Among the
few who have fully answered the expectations of the
missionaries, is Leang-Afa, who received his early
and lasting impressions while engaged as a printer
to this institution. If native teachers are to become
the chief instruments in the conversion of the nations,
schools of this kind are probably the means by which
they are to be trained for their office. For some
years past, the number of young Chinese in the
college has averaged between twenty-five and thirty.
The aim of the teachers is to give them instruction in
Christian books, translated into their own language—
also to teach them English, and improve them in
their own literature. All the Chinese in any capacity
connected with the institution, are called together
every morning at seven o'clock, for reading the
Scriptures, prayer, and singing. Those who do not
understand Chinese, are assembled for the same
purpose by the Malay missionary, an hour later. The
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 245 -->
remainder of the time is devoted to their several
employments, and the day is concluded as it was
commenced.


On the Sabbath, there is preaching in the chapel
belonging to the Society, by both the missionaries, in
the languages of their respective departments. Two
or three stated services are also held in the week,
generally in the school-rooms, where a small number
assemble, and are conducted like the one described
above.


Attached to the college is a printing
establishment, where a large proportion of the Christian books
distributed at the different Chinese stations is
prepared. There are also fonts of English and Arabic
type, the latter for the Malayan language. Malacca
is highly and justly celebrated for the number of its
native schools. Children of Chinese, Malay,
Portuguese, and Kaling parents, are all taught, in their
respective languages, the truths of Christianity.


There are, at present, about one hundred and
fifty, or two hundred, Chinese boys, belonging to the
schools superintended by the principal of the college;
one hundred Chinese girls, under the instruction of
Miss Wallace; between two hundred and fifty and
three hundred Malay children, under the care of
Mr. Hughes, the Malay missionary; and about two
hundred more, principally Tamul and Portuguese, in
charge of the ladies belonging to the Resident's
household, and one or two others of a kindred spirit,
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 246 -->
who live in the place. These schools, as the reader
may infer, afford a fine sphere for female usefulness.
They have been blessed with the influence and efficient
labours of active ladies, and might be made still
more extensively beneficial if they received the
patronage from abroad which they require*. Alas
that this should be the chief complaint in every
place where efforts are made for the conversion ofthe
heathen ! In every plan of Christian benevolence,
the missionaries and teachers find a liberal patron, an
efficient coadjutor, and a most congenial friend, in
{empty}S. Garling, Esq., Resident ofthe station.


On Tuesday evening, March 27th, I left Malacca
in a native brig, bound for Singapore, with such a


* Since the above was written, some of the girls' schools have
been suspended for want of funds, and two or three ladies, who
took an active part in teaching, have been removed. It is highly
important that female education in Malacca, and in all the East,
should be taken up by ladies at home, and supported with the zeal
and perseverance which the object demands.—Note by the Author.

The Society for the promotion of Female Education in China,
India, and the East, was formed in July 1834, to meet these
necessities. A grant of £50 has already been transmitted to the
Malacca schools; and the Committee have made choice of a lady
in all respects well fitted for the work, who is now (March 1835)
on the point of proceeding thither to undertake their
superintendence; Miss Wallace, of whom mention is made above,
having been removed to Siam to begin the work of education
there. The Committee hope shortly to send an agent to Singapore;
and they believe that, in many ofthe places mentioned in this work,
schools might be established, with every prospect of success, were
a sufficient amount of funds placed at their disposal to enable
them thus to extend their efforts. Further particulars respecting
the object and proceedings of this Society will be found in their
statements, published by Edward Suter, 19 Cheapside.—Editor.

number of fellow-passengers, principally Chinese, as
at night filled the berths, covered the floor of the
poop-cabin, occupied nearly all the space below
decks, and rendered it difficult to walk without
treading upon some of them. Owing to calms, opposing
winds, and numerous obstructions on the uncoppered
bottom of the vessel, we did not arrive until Monday
morning, April 2d.


When confined for a number of days with the
same persons, it is difficult, without great command
oftheir language, to obey the call of duty and
compassion towards them. The subject of Christianity,
after being introduced a few times, and enlarged
upon sufficiently to teach them how they can be
saved, becomes stale, and requires a variety of
phraseology to place it in different lights, and render
it at all interesting. One expedient has been adopted,
I believe with profit. When assembled in groups
for conversation, of which they are very fond, I have
accosted them; offered the most respectable of their
number a Christian book, to read, and explain for the
edification of the rest; and then myself joined the
company upon the floor, as an auditor and occasional
prompter. At these seasons I have felt the deepest
interest in interceding in their behalf, and could not
but hope that the plan would be blest.


After returning to Singapore, the writer awaited
the first opportunity of proceeding to Siam. During
<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 248 -->
this interval he frequently assisted Mr. Thomsen in
the distribution of books, both on shore and in the
harbour. The season at which the Chinese visit the
tombs afforded an opportunity for much exertion,
both in teaching them orally and in dispersing books.
All the junks from China, and others from Siam
manned with Chinese sailors, were supplied.


April 18th.—I embarked last evening in a Chinese
junk for Siam. An effort was made to procure a
passage immediately on my arrival from Malacca,
but the captains of the junks refused to take me,
for fear of incurring the displeasure of the Siamese
king. I am indebted for this opportunity to the
kindness of W. Scott, Esq., the custom-house officer,
who has great influence with the Chinese owing to
his situation.


The junk is about three hundred tons burden. In
construction she is rather superior to the majority of
Chinese vessels, presenting a less stem-like,
semilunar, bow to the water, and consequently being
swifter and safer. She carries upwards of forty men,
and has one or two passengers besides myself. Mine
is the only white face and English tongue on board.
It will probably surprise a Western sailor to learn that
the men receive only about fifteen dollars a voyage,
which consumes generally from four tonine months;
and it will be no less amusing to a Western traveller
to hear that a native passenger pays but four dollars
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 249 -->
from Singapore to Siam—that is to -say, for one
certainly, and sometimes for two, months' board and
lodging.


The place assigned to me is a box on the
quarterdeck, resembling an oven, and so straitened in its
dimensions that it will hold very little more than
myself: nor can I sit upright except upon a low
trunk. With the exception of the Captain, who
probably wishes to frighten me out of a little more
money, or into a little less comfort than was stipulated,
the crew, though rough, are civil and obliging.


19th.—I have succeeded in changing my
apartment for one next it, less attractive in external
appearance, but rather broader and cooler. The
Captain has relaxed the muscles of his face, and
we are all now on the best possible terms. It is a
great source of amusement to them to see me walk
the deck for exercise. Bodily exertion of any kind
appears to the minds of all these natives to be
incompatible with comfort. They have an idea that this
exercise must be a religious performance; and, when
I come out, they frequently mention the number of
steps and turns which the duty demands. I attempt
to shew them, by disappointing all their conjectures,
that this is the suggestion of their own fancies. It
requires much presence of mind, in taking recreation,
not to interfere with some of their strange notions.
They have an idea that walking with the hands
behind the back is an ill omen, and retards the progress  
  
  
  M 5
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 250 -->
of the vessel. b Other whims, too numerous and
absurd to mention, prove rather annoying, where
there is little disposition to be unbending in trifles,
and none to indulge them in their superstitions. I
find it an excellent school for improvement in
that dialect of the language which is of most service
in Siam.


21st.—All things go on well but the junk, and she
reminds one of a well-saturated log of wood, in her
grievous, groaning movements. For the last
fortyeight hours it is doubtful whether we have made
more than half that number of miles. When the
wind is a-beam, so great is the lee-way that there is
but little advantage in weighing the large wooden
anchor. If from any cause they are obliged to
lower the main-sail, it is painful to witness the
exertion of muscles and lungs required to hoist the
cumbrous mat * to its place : two windlasses—one
of which extends across the junk, and the other from
the mainmast to the side—are put in requisition, in
this laborious task. The Chinese seem determined
to lay their muscles under the least possible
obligation to mechanical agency. When they wish to pump
the ship, a pole is placed across, at some height above
the - hatch-way, to which a pulley is suspended.
At one end of the rope passing through the pulley, a
large bucket is let down, and drawn up by a number
of men at the other end, while one or two are stationed  
  
  
  * The sails of native vessels are generally made of mats.
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 251 -->
below to fill it. The work goes on most cheerfully,
though with little shew of subordination—the sailors
having generally as much to say as the officers, and
the officers as much to do as the sailors.


23d.—Last night the riot and revel of idolatry
commenced. From the parade of gongs, gilt paper,
and other ominous articles with which I was familiar,
I was apprised of their intentions, and my spirit was
stirred within me. I raised my voice; endeavoured to
convince them of their error, ridiculed their folly,
warned them of their guilt, tried every expedient; but
all in vain. The gongs and drums struck up, the
paper was lighted and cast into the sea, and the vain
offering quickly and irreverently finished. They told
me that the morrow was the birth-day of their
goddess Ma-cho-po.


This morning, at dawn of day, the same service
was performed, and again at eight o'clock, with
many additional offerings of flesh, fish, and cake.
Again I summoned my tongue to the contest; but
with no better success than before. Some laughed;
others were angry. The chief officer, to whose
reason an appeal was made, and whose previous
conduct had convinced me that he was a man of sense,
took my interference in high dudgeon. My boy,
feeling apprehensive of the consequences of
denouncing their popular deity with such forwardness, came
and begged me to desist. I certainly had no intention
of irritating them needlessly, nor any fear of
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 252 -->
attempting what a sense of duty prompted. What grieved
me peculiarly, was the office of a quiet, interesting
man, somewhat advanced in life, who had read the
Christian books in my cabin, and who appeared to
comprehend many of their truths. Instead of
manifesting the least regard for what he had been taught,
he stood before the image, kneeled a number of
times, and bowed his hoary head almost to the deck.
There was but one retreat from this affecting scene,
and were it not for this refuge, the missionary's
heart would often sink in utter despondency beneath
the pressure of his trials. 'Oh how refreshing is it,
at such seasons, to pour out the soul in prayer to
Him who not only has the power, but has announced
His determination to destroy idolatry, and restore His
ignorant, rebellious creatures to Himself.


The conversation on the subject of idolatry
commenced publicly this morning, and resumed at
different times throughout the day, will, Isincerely hope,
lead them to reflect upon the stupidity, as well as the
crime, of worshipping those whom they acknowledge
to have been but men, and whose dumb images only
they thus reverence. One favourite plea with them
is, that different countries have different customs—
in other words, that fashion is law, and her dictates
absolute. Another reason, which, if true, would be
more rational, is, that those whom they worship,
though they were mortals like themselves, have been
transformed into gods as the reward of their merit.
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 253 -->

One thing, already mentioned, which gives peculiar
zest to a Chinaman's sacrifice, is the feast which
follows. A good-sized porker, preserved many months
for the occasion, was slaughtered this morning, and,
after the formal presentation of part of it to the
image, applied to the purpose for which it was really
intended. They had been living before upon rice,
salt fish, and vegetables, and were prepared to
welcome and enjoy this temporary change of diet. Of
all their ordinary meats, pork is the favourite among
the Chinese.


May 2d.—Contrary to expectation, we were not
out of sight of land more than twenty-four hours.
Five days have nearly passed since we opened the
rugged scenery of Tringano, and though we have
been proceeding with all sails set, and a considerable
breeze during part of the time, we have scarcely
succeeded in leaving it out of sight. Tringano
appears to be a projection from the peninsula of
Malacca, peculiarly varied in its general aspect, and
notable for its piracies. It is said that the Rajah is
the head of the banditti. I was by no means sorry
to learn that our vessel is too large to invite an
attack from these desperate marauders. About three
years ago, my friend and fellow-missionary, Mr.
Medhurst, visited this place in a small boat, and
encountered the most frightful dangers from pirates
on the way.  
  
  
  This afternoon another feat of idolatry was
<!-- Leaf 292, Page: 254 -->
performed. It was intended as an act of homage to the
presiding deity of a hill, opposite to which we are
sailing. Lamps were lighted, paper burned, cakes
and fruit spread on a mat, the gongs rung, and the
aged man, spoken of before, bowed his head a
number of times nearly to the deck. My spirits have
seldom sunk so low. After what has been said, which
their reason assents to, the noise sounded to me like
the knell of the second death.


9th.—Last night we encountered a severe squall.
The lightning, thunder, wind, and rain, gave to the
scene a sublimity, which the hurried confusion and
want of skill evident among the boatmen would have
converted into terror to my mind, had it not been
for "my hiding-place and my shield." When the
squall came on, the mate called for gold paper, and,
holding it up in the face of the storm, bowed, and
threw it into the deep. It would probably have
puzzled his own imagination to decide, what
particular deity he was thus appeasing.


Last year it is said that thirty or forty vessels
were lost, on their return from different places.
My teacher says that seventeen which sailed from
Siam, and four out of six from Singapore, bound
for China, never arrived. Several hundreds of their
own coasting vessels are reported to have met with a
similar destiny.


For two days we have been sailing in the vicinity
of most interesting upland scenery. It varies, from
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 255 -->
the small mound, through almost every gradation of
height and peculiarity of formation, to the lofty
mountain, at whose feet this morning's mists were
spread in delicate fleeces, and whose majestic head
overlooks the floating clouds which love to linger
around it. The castellated form of some ofthe peaks,
rising to a considerable perpendicular elevation, is a
peculiar feature.


On the coasts of the Malayan peninsula there are
a number of native states, in which, according to the
belief of those who have visited them, missionaries
might reside and labour. Some of these are subject
to the king of Siam, and the rest are under the
Government of native Rajahs. From the most authentic
information that could be obtained, both from the
natives themselves and the Malays in their vicinity,
it appears that there are four tribes of aborigines
living in the Malayan peninsula, and known by their
original names, namely, Samang, Sakei, Udei, and
Rayat. In stature and features they are all like the
Malays.


The Samang tribe live in the depths of the forest,
and never come down to the villages. They neither
sow nor plant, but subsist upon the fruits of the
forest and the spoils of the chase. Their sole
employment is hunting. Whatever they meet they kill
with the sumpit, and eat all, whether bird, beast, or
reptile. Their language is not understood by any
but themselves. They lisp their words, the sound of
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 256 -->
which is very indistinct, more like the noise of birds
than the voices of men. They have neither king nor
chief, but there is one, whom they style Put/ung, to
whom they refer all their requests and complaints,
invariably abiding by his decision. They have no
religion, no priests, and no ideas whatever of a
Supreme Being, the creation of the world, the soul of
man, sin, heaven, hell, angels, or a day of judgment.
The puy ung instructs them in matters relating to
ghosts, evil spirits, and sorcery, by the belief of which
they are all influenced. They never quarrel nor go
to war with another tribe. When one of the Samang
tribe dies, the head only is buried; the body is eaten
by the people, who collect in large numbers for that

purpose.


The other aborigines were originally one tribe only,
known in Malacca by the name Jakon; from them
sprang the Sakei, Udei, and Rayat. These tribes are
much alike, and speak the same language, though
they keep distinct. These three cultivate the ground,
trade in the neighbouring villages, and bury their
dead. The bark of trees furnishes them with
clothing, the roots and leaves with medicine, and the
branches and foliage with shelter for the night.
They are entirely ignorant of their own history,
neither knowing whence, nor how, nor when, they
came to the country *.


* These particulars are extracted from a small sheet published
in the Straits of Malacca some time ago.
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 257 -->

10th.—To-day there was a new feast of idolatry,
new at least to me. A raft of bamboos was prepared,
which they almost filled with gold and silver paper.
This they let down into the sea, and then fired the
paper, amidst the noise of the gong, the solemn
antics ofthe old man, and the offering ofa variety of
eatables, some of which, with less than their usual
wisdom, were thrown into the water.


14th.—Last night we cast anchor outside the bar,
at the mouth of the Meinam; and now we are
waiting for dispatches from the owner at Bankok.
Notwithstanding the rigid laws of the kingdom
against the importation of opium, and the rank and
office of the person to whom the junk belongs, we
have a quantity on board, which will no doubt detain
us, until safely smuggled on shore. The weather is
very oppressive. Scarcely a breath of air finds its
way into my apartment, while the sun beats upon it
with his fiercest rays. We find ourselves greatly
favoured, notwithstanding the apparent dulness of
our daily progress. Two junks came to anchor
shortly after we arrived, one of which sailed a month,
and the other half a month, before us. I had been
disappointed—providentially and happily, as I now
find it to be—of a passage in the latter.


Thus ends the voyage. I have seldom, if ever,
been so much impressed with the degradation of the
heathen, as during the month spent on board this
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 258 -->
junk. How striking, how total, the change which
the Gospel of Jesus makes in a rational mind! In
fact, no mind is rational, until restored to its original
harmony by the influence of the Gospel. The
condition ofthe heathen is more deplorable than that of
many maniacs in Christian lands, for these may have
lucid intervals; they are sunk below the brutes, for
their apprehension of things is correct as far as it
goes; they are beneath the very stock and stone they
worship, for these cannot mistake their worshippers
for dead men—while their worshippers madly
confound them with the living. It is better to have no
ideas on any subject, than wrong impressions of
every important truth. Let those who say there are
no advantages in the Christian religion, come forth
and look upon these heathen. Civilization—if that
which has not a true religion for its basis merits the
name—has been exerting its influence for centuries
among the nation to which this crew belongs. And
yet what do they know ? All that they behold in
creation—all that they witness in providence—all
that their reason can suggest—does not lead them,
neither did it lead their sages, to the obvious
conclusion that there is one, and but one, Supreme Being.
With respect to the object of the present life, the
realities of the future, and every thing relating to
their eternal interests, no phrensied imagination could
be wilder. And this ignorance extends not only to
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 259 -->
the most important of all truths, but also to the most
simple subjects of worldly science. Of history,
geography, astronomy, philosophy, medicine, all of
which they profess to understand, they know but
very little; and the influence of that little is nullified
by the mass of error with which it is mixed up. I
sincerely hope that the mode and frequency of social
worship, and the observance of the Sabbath which
they have witnessed, with the books distributed, and
our frequent conversations, may be blessed to the
eternal welfare of some of these ignorant but amiable
men. Four of us have daily crowded into my little
den, and regularly maintained a morning and evening
service. It has been a source of frequent regret
that there was no place on board sufficiently spacious
to accommodate more, except where the noise and
bustle were so great as to prevent the performance of
religious worship.


16th.—Still at anchor. A number of Chinese
junks returning to the empire, and of smaller ones
passing to and from the Meinam, gives much life to
the scene. There are, it is said, upwards of eighty
vessels trading between China and Siam this season.
Besides the exercise of patience, it affords a
favourable opportunity, as the eye ranges over a part of this
heathen kingdom, to reflect upon the nature and
dreadful responsibility of the missionary work under
existing circumstances. Were it not for the promise
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 260 -->
of sufficient grace, and the constant intercessions of
our Advocate with the Father, the mind would recoil
from the contemplation, and, if it could not bury
itself in forgetfulness, would lie down in despair.
And why should one be left to attempt that alone,
which devolves upon many, as an equal duty, and
demands the united labours of a host? Can the
unwillingness, or even the deepest sense of unfitness
to come up to the help ofthe Lord, release any from
the obligation imposed by the Saviour's command?
Exalted, but neglected, Saviour, arise, and plead
thine own cause; then shall the heathen be saved !


19th (Friday).—After a detention of three days,
before the owner could receive information of our
arrival, and the opium be transferred to vessels
better adapted for smuggling, we weighed anchor,
and entered the Meinam. A fresh and free breeze
soon wafted us to Paknam, which is the post ofthe
first revenue officer. The river thus far is lined with
a thick jungle, with no cleared spots, and with but
one or two fishermen's huts along the shore. The
following morning a number of Government officers
came on board, and after drinking tea, and disputing
with the Captain for some time about the amount of
presents, or more properly bribes, which each should
receive, they bore away their fardels, and left us to
proceed. They did not know but that every box on
board, except one of mine, which attracted their
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 261 -->
curiosity, and every part of the ship, except the
most exposed places, were stowed with contraband
goods.


The curiosity of the Siamese and country-born
Chinese appears very childish to a stranger. While
I was sitting conversing with one of them, two or
three were behind me, examining my dress, and
lifting up the outer garment to see the texture and
number of those within. Their cupidity is as
annoying as their curiosity is amusing. Their ideas of
beneficence are limited to deeds of alms-giving—
chiefly the support of the priests—and when one of
them, of some rank, heard that I was engaged in
labours of benevolence, he gave me no rest from his
unwearied importunity—first begging for what caught
his eyes, and then for money. That I should have
come to Siam without the expectation or desire of
amassing wealth—merely to teach them about the
God of heaven, and give them books and medicine—
was so incredible, to those who had heard little of the
missionaries before, that they would repeat again
aud again the same question about my object in
coming, as though the reply they uniformly received
was too,absurd to claim a moment's remembrance.


When the morning scene had closed, and the tide
suited, we proceeded up the river, doubtful whether
we should be able to pass the situation of another
custom-house officer, about twelve miles further,
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 262 -->
without some detention. This officer did not even
board us. Here, as at Paknam, are batteries on each
side of the river, one of which is very extensive, with
a collection of native huts in their vicinity. On
Friday morning I left the junk at anchor a few
miles below Bankok, and came up in a small boat
to the house of our former patron and friend, Mr.
Silveira.
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 263 -->
  
  CHAPTER XII.  
  
  
  SIAM.

My second residence in Siam lasted between five
and six months. The object which hastened my
departure from the straits, before there could be a
rational hope of the restoration of health, was to
supply the Chinese junks, about returning to the
empire, with Christian books. It appeared so
doubtful whether, even if I remained longer at Singapore,
I should not be eventually compelled to try a change
to a colder climate, that I felt determined rather to
hazard the experiment upon my health, than to suffer
an opportunity of such extensive usefulness to pass
unimproved. With the blessing of the Lord, striking
and encouraging in many respects, I arrived in time
to furnish about fifty junks, bound for China and
Hainan, its dependency, with the Scriptures and
Christian books. The delay of a week would have
lessened this number materially. Nearly thirty had
already sailed, and the rest were hastening away with
the greatest dispatch. The mornings and evenings
of nearly three weeks were thus employed, at the
close of which time a return of debility restricted me
<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 264 -->
to in-door labours, and even these received but a
superficial attention.


The most hopeful circumstance concerning the
mission, is the number ofattendants upon our Sabbath
services. Between twelve and twenty Chinese have
generally been present—few indeed, contrasted with
the myriads who cling with madness to their idols,
but encouraging when compared with the past. Our
auditory has been gradually increased by a species of
management, which, had I remained, would probably
have swelled it to a large congregation. In conversing
with the numerous applicants for medicine, I told
such as I thought could well attend, of our Sabbath
service, and appointed that day and hour for them
to come for a fresh supply of medicine. Many who
commenced their attendance through these means,
became too much interested in their new pursuit to
discontinue it. Besides this, about half a dozen have
enjoyed the benefit of daily worship and catechetical
instruction. The effect has been, that the majority
have had their ideas on the doctrines of Christianity
greatly enlarged, aud a few have manifested such an
effect of the truth upon their hearts as I sincerely
hope may prove to them the dawn of an eternal day.
These have rejected their idols, and established the
daily worship of the true God.


I have not ventured to baptize any, and,
consequently, term none of them converts. The most
hopeful have lived too far off, to bring them under
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 265 -->
such a course of instruction as seems important,
where the mind is just emerging from gross darkness,
and where the light itself shines so dimly. I expected
soon to leave the place, and feared that a change of
circumstances might produce a change in their
impressions and conduct; and, what was more, I knew
that if they were the children of God, they would
remain such—if not, the administration of this rite
might prove a source of delusion to their own minds,
and of scandal to those around them. The person
who was baptized by my predecessor, Mr. Gutzlaff,
appears to know the truth in the love of it. He has
renounced all the absurd notions and customs
sanctioned by their religious creeds, and blended with the
renown of their ancient moralists—an evidence of
mental renovation which can be estimated only by
those who know how the Chinese plume themselves
upon the parade of this knowledge, and with what
difficulty they are made to abandon it as absurd.


The Siamese were much more reserved than before,
probably at the suggestion of those who begin to
open their eyes upon the consequences of intercourse
with us, and tremble for the doom of their gods and
temples. A fabric of idolatry so extensive and
consolidated as the prevailing religion of Siam, based
upon the interests of a vast body, a nation of
priests, supported by the superstition, the pride, and
of course the power, of the Kings, the princes, and
the whole community; cannot be expected even to  
  
  
  N
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 266 -->
totter upon the application of so slight a force as we
have brought to bear against it. This remark is
made, to guard against the impression of many that
the ruling powers of Siam, and the community at
large, are rather the patrons than the opposers of
Christianity. However favourably the few who
examined the subject may have received it when it was
a novelty, and a matter of curious inquiry, yet that
was not the time of trial.


The power of the truth in pulling down
strongholds without—their venerated temples and idols,—
and the still stronger holds within—even all their
sacred associations and deep-rooted habits—had not
been experienced nor understood. Neither do I
believe it to be yet known, except to a very limited
extent, although there appears to have been
suspicions in the minds of a few, of the object and
probable tendency of our labours in the kingdom.


Medical knowledge is calculated to give influence
to the missionary. It attracts many, from different
and distant parts, to whom we could otherwise have
no possible access. It affords an opportunity for
instructing those who come, and lays them under such
obligations as can be made available in securing both
their attention to the remarks made, and their
attendance upon the established ordinances of religion.
But this charity is dictated by a regard to the welfare
of this life, as well as of the life to come. The most
common complaints are those which yield readily to
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 267 -->
our applications, but whose permanent cure baffles
the skill of the natives, and resists the power of all
their medicines.


The following are a few extracts from the journal
kept at the time.


May 21st.—A busy day. Great numbers came for
books—more than I remember ever to have seen
before. They were principally Hainan men, from a
vessel which is building in our neighbourhood. This
afternoon I commenced visiting the China junks, to
supply them with the Scriptures, and other religious
books. Having a letter to the Captain of the port,
who acts as interpreter between foreigners and the
Prah Kiang, I called at his house, and was informed
that the King had commanded his officers to prohibit
me from distributing the books which he heard I
had brought with me. " If we wanted to disseminate
our religion," his Majesty remarked, " we must go
to some other country." Many considerations
prevented a change in my plans, and, looking for wisdom
to Him in whose hand are the hearts of kings,
I went from the interpreter's house to the great
business on which I came forth. In four of the five
junks visited, the books were well received.
Occasionally I meet with those who are full of all kinds of
suspicion, and with whom but little can be done.


22d I arose early, and went on board of four
junks. In the first I met with a man who appeared
not only friendly, but acquainted, at least to some  
  
  
  N 2
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 268 -->
extent, with the true God, and his redeeming Son.
After a little conversation, he said that he was a
A'elestan [Christian, according to his pronunciation]
belonging to the island of Hainan *—that there were
three or four Padres, and about three thousand
native Christians [Papists] on the island. It confirms
the account that I had previously received, respecting
the Catholics having retained a considerable footing
there, when expelled from China. I gave him the
Scriptures, and a number of other books, some of
which he promised to carry to his friends ofthe same
profession at home. From his unreserved manner,
he could scarcely have suspected that there was any
difference between me and his own priests, although
he said, in reply to a question on the subject, that
they did not distribute the Scriptures in the Chinese
language.


I have been again somewhat troubled with a
confirmation of yesterday's report. Mr. Silveira, having
business with the acting Prah Kiang, was informed
that the King had really said the books must not be
distributed in his kingdom. Mr. S. thinks, and with
much reason, that the priests are taking the alarm f,
and employing their influence with the King topre
*A large island to the south of China, between 18 and 20
degrees North Latitude, and 108 and 111 degrees East Longitude.
It must not be confounded with the little island of Hainam"
mentioned p. 70.—Ed.

{empty}t.The King's officers admitted that it did not interfere with his
Majesty's command to supply the Chinese junks with books,
though I neither promised nor intended to confine myself to them.
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 269 -->
vent their downfal. I think I never enjoyed the
Second Psalm so much as to-day.


June the 12th.—Since the last date I have been
employed, early and late, in visiting about fifty junks.
With a very few exceptions, the books have been
thankfully received, and the instructions and
exhortations, though often brief and feeble, have been
heard with attention—I hope with profit. The
employment has sometimes been delightful. Every where a
most hearty welcome was given, and at times the
noisy, though respectful, salutation of the gong has
been added. Often has it been cheering to witness
the readiness with which the most important
doctrines of Christianity were comprehended, and
animating has been the assurance that " our labour is not
in vain in the Lord." Oh, how easy to the power of
Omnipotence is the conversion of a fallen world !
This is our dependence—here we rest; and our
constant and only aim should be to have Jehovah " make
bare His arm " in this glorious work.


June 25th.—My attention has been lately confined
to in-door labours. Among the numerous patients
were two most pitiable objects. One of them was
speechless, and unable to walk, from paralysis; but
so sensitively alive to his miserable condition, that
he wept in anguish at the probability of never being
restored. Even if relief was attainable by the efficacy
of medicine and the skill of the practitioner, they
have not sufficient patience to be healed. Often have
<!-- Leaf 308, Page: 270 -->
they come with inveterate diseases, and though they
have been forewarned of the consequences of not
repeating their calls, yet, from not being healed
immediately, they have lost their faith in the remedy,
and never applied again.


The most trying circumstance of the past week,
and one which has called forth many a sigh, is the
conduct of the boy who had been with me for nearly
a year, and who I hoped had "passed from death
unto life." He had been addicted to intemperance
before he entered our service, but for a long time had
appeared to be perfectly reformed. While at
Singapore with me, he had to associate, in the family in
which I lived, with a profligate fellow-servant, whom
I have heard him warn against the evil consequences
of dissipation, but who seduced him into the very
crimes he had himself so solemnly condemned.
Before I suspected the least misdemeanour, his
conduct had become so offensive to the public, that I
was compelled to dismiss him immediately from my
service. I know of nothing more painful to a
missionary's heart than an event of this kind. Those
who have followed to the grave a cherished child—
one who was their solace in loneliness, and their
hope in coming years—may form some idea of this
trial. But, no! what is a bodily pang, a temporary
separation, to spiritual, eternal wretchedness ! To
see the " rulers of darkness " re-capture those who
we hoped had been wrested from their dominion, and
<!-- Leaf 309, Page: 271 -->
to find the gloom of the second death closing upon
those who we fondly believed had emerged into light;
produce, for the moment, something of the agony
belonging to the destiny of the lost.


July 7th.—Several circumstances have rendered
this week one of more than ordinary interest. Among
these was a visit for books from two men who had
obtained some notion of the true God, and the
questions of one of whom manifested a strong
conviction ofthe credibility ofthe Christian religion. This
poor man, when inquiring about the manner of Divine
worship, was confounded at every step. To worship
without images, pictures, or inscriptions of any kind;
without incense-sticks, offerings of eatables, or any
of those rites with which every thing sacred is
connected in his mind; was more than he could readily
digest. Some of them exhibit, when we talk to them,
the wonder of children in hearing a marvellous tale.
The great deceiver has persuaded them that the right
exercise ofthe heart is a secondary and quite an
unimportant matter in sacred duties.


Yesterday the man whom Mr.Gutzlaff had baptized
called for the first time. He had been absent to
Cochin-China and China, and had discovered, from
more than mere observation, that, notwithstanding
the similarity of name, our doctrines and those of the
Roman Catholics were very different. He said they
would not acknowledge him in Amoy, although he
confessed himself a disciple of Jesus, and shewed his
<!-- Leaf 310, Page: 272 -->
credentials. That idol which they adored, and the
strange, unintelligible mode of their worship, were
quite as offensive to him, as his knowledge of the
Saviour, and ignorance of their abominations, were
to them.


I have been visited three or four times, by two
of the interesting Chinese spoken of in a previous
part of this journal. They came expressly for
Divine worship, and would repeat their visits more
frequently, were it not for the distance of their
residence from us. This morning they brought an
acquaintance with them, who had some knowledge of
the books, and who cheerfully engaged with us in our
usual service. Our friends had been rather before-hand
in their reckoning, having mistaken this day
(Saturday) for the Sabbath. The elder, besides his other
good qualities, is the personification of Chinese
politeness : the other is too modest and retiring to exhibit
what his kind heart dictates.


17th.—Passing down the river yesterday evening,
we saw a knot of persons assembled, in two or three
places, attending to the discourses of the priests. At
one of the houses where we stopped for a few moments,
an old, spectacled Talapoin was seated on a platform
preaching to an assembly, chiefly of women, who
listened in the reverential posture of Siam,—sitting
with their feet concealed, and their hands raised to
the level of their faces. The dull monotony of the
old man's chaunt is usually relieved by a timely
<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 273 -->
interlude of music, but we did not stop to witness this
part of the performance.


The present month is the commencement of the
Pnzssa/i.which lasts for three successive months, being
the longest sacred season in the year. It is observed in
commemoration of the time that Somnahkodom *,
the last incarnation of Buddh, disappeared from this
world. They say that he left three impressions of his
feet on earth—one in Siam, another in Burmah, and
a third in Ceylon. Pilgrimages are frequently made
to the vestige visible in the hill-country of Siam; and
are considered to be as meritorious by these idolaters,
as is a visit to the holy city of the Jews, the
Mahommedans, or the Catholics, by their respective devotees.


During this protracted season the priests are kept
most busily engaged. Every day there is service at
the palace, at the mansions of many of the principal
men in the kingdom, and frequently at the houses
of the common people. This service is kept up
at the palace throughout the year. The night which
closes the Prassah is a season of many ceremonies,
and much noise. Guns are fired from the forts
surrounding the city, at short intervals, until morning,
after which, for a long time, lamps are suspended
upon high poles by all who can afford the expense.


* According to tradition, the brother of Somnahkodom, a great
malefactor, was crucified for his crimes. I have been asked
whether he and Jesus were not the same. The devil would no doubt
have it believed, according to similar attempts (e.g. the Philippian
damsel), that Christ and this infamous character were one.  
  
  
  N 5
<!-- Leaf 312, Page: 274 -->
The object of the noise is to frighten away the evil
spirits from these precincts—the lights are to prevent
the return of these dreaded genii.


Other means are employed by the priests for the
same purpose. They often surround a place, from
which they wish to debar their invisible enemies, with
a thread, which their incantatory powers can, they
imagine, render an impassable barrier. The whole
walled city is thus guarded. Even human bodies are
believed to be secured from demoniacal possession by
the same means. Similar methods are employed by
the priests in taking alligators, when they appear in
the river; and, according tothe uniform testimony of
spectators, they generally prove successful. In
statements of this kind, and many others equally incredible,
I have been at a loss what to believe. If the priests
are not assisted by the spirits whom they profess to
controul, they" must possess all their power, or they
never could impose upon such a variety of witnesses.


Before we reached home, my ears were shocked
by an oath in English from one of the heathen boys
who was assisting to propel the boat. It was the
only phrase he uttered in that language, and in all
probability the only one he knew. It reminded me of
a similar expression, which I had heard from one of
another nation, residing in Siam, and who possessed
no other acquaintance with the English tongue
than this offensive sentence. The language of
cursing, and the habit of brandy drinking, are
<!-- Leaf 313, Page: 275 -->
considered in many heathen nations as characteristics of
Christians*.


31st.—Yesterday afternoon the prince Chow Fah f
sent for me to dine at his house. The message was
conveyed in such a manner as to admit of no refusal,
although it was raining at the time, and likely to
continue doing so. We are often obliged to gratify the
princes contrary to our inclinations, that we may secure
their favour, and be better enabled to benefit them and
their nation. The entertainment was in the European
style, and consisted of a variety of dishes. He did
not partake with us, it being the custom of the
princes to eat alone—but apologized, by saying that
he had dined already.


After dinner he amused us with music upon some
of their native instruments, being himself an amateur,
and aided by the vocal strains of one of his
attendants. As was before mentioned, there is a striking
contrast, between the musical powers of the Chinese
and Siamese altogether in favour of the talent and
taste of the latter. Their instruments are much more
melodious, and their voices softer and more natural.
They usually employ two percussion instruments,
borrowed probably from the Javanese. These are both
on the principle of the harmonica : one of them being


* Bruce met with a person in the interior of Abyssinia who had
picked up a few words of English, and those the vilest in the

<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 276 -->
made of transverse pieces of bamboo suspended by
strings upon a small shallop frame-work; the other
consisting of a number of hollow copper vessels of
different sizes hung upon a circular frame. Their
sweetest wind-instruments are borrowed from the Laos.
They are made of a number of reeds of unequal lengths
put together, and perforated so as to give the necessary
distinction of notes. The prince performs with much
taste on this instrument. The more we see of this
young man, the more are we struck with the variety
of his talents. Oh that the Saviour would verify in
his case that prediction and promise, " Kings shall
see and arise, princes also shall worship !"


September 2d. — Our little worshipping assembly
has just dispersed. About twenty were present.
It is so affecting to have a company of poor Pagans
assemble on the Lord's-day, to hear the doctrines of
the Gospel, and to bow the knee to their great
Author, that I can scarcely endure the thought of
leaving them, and am at times uncertain whether
even measures for self-preservation ought not to yield
to the claims ofa whole kingdom. I must, however,
remember, that if the first be necessary, the other
must in any case be abandoned. " The harvest truly
is great, but the labourers are few."


Two circumstances, which have recently occurred,
are likely to promote the objects of the mission.
They have been constructing a brick foot-path
between our premises and the Chinese settlement.
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 277 -->
The way was almost impassable before, even to the
bare-footed Peripatetics. It is now made of materials,
and in a manner, which will probably surmount the
height of the annual flood, and resist the action of
its waters. Though a miserable place to walk upon for
exercise, on account of the narrowness of the way,
the crowd of passengers, and, what is worst of all,
the number and annoyance ofthe dogs, yet it is the
only alternative, during the greater part of the year,
to remaining within our own little enclosure, and it is
essential to the prosecution of those external duties
which ought not to be neglected in this mission. Its
chief advantage, however, is the facility with which
visitors, patients, and worshippers, can come to the
house.


The other circumstance is an agreement entered
into with Chow Fah, which affords to me
advantages for the acquisition of the language, and
opens a door for instructing him. Every second day
he sends for me to come and teach him English, and
the alternate day he sends a teacher to instruct
me in Siamese. Want of health prevents me from
availing myself of the benefits of the arrangement
except in a limited measure, and I am sorry to
find that want of inclination, or fear, debars him from
the full advantages of that information which I am
chiefly anxious to impart. He bids fair for the throne,
and is perhaps afraid of any thing which might
render his success doubtful. He hears much,
however, in the way of circumlocution. In fact, I am only
<!-- Leaf 316, Page: 278 -->
withheld from the plainest, most pointed conversation,
by the apprehension of defeating my own object;
and when there are sufficient grounds for dismissing
this apprehension, the effort, in the Lord's strength,
shall be made. Still I very much fear that an
imperfect knowledge of his language renders all my
instructions comparatively unavailing.


13th.—To-day Mr. Hunter sent for us, to witness
a sight which has attracted much attention in Siam,
and would be considered equally strange in more
enlightened countries. It was a young child sporting
in the water as in its native element, with all the
buoyancy and playfulness of a fish. Its evolutions
are astonishing—sometimes rolling over, with a rapid
motion, and apparently no exertion; then turning
round like a hoop, by bending its face under, as it
lies on its back, and throwing its feet over its head.
It floats like a cork, with no apparent motion of any
ofthe muscles; occasionally allows itself to sink until
only the half of its head is seen; dives; holds its
face underwater long enough to alarm those who are
ignorant of its powers; and yet appears to breathe as
easily as though it had suffered no suspension of
respiration. It is evidently delighted with the
exercise; evinces no fatigue, nor the least
apprehension, and often cries when taken up. It is a singular
object, both in the water and out of it. It is three
years old, very small, can neither speak nor walk, is
very defective in sight, will take no food but its
earliest provision—in fact, appears quite idiotic—and
<!-- Leaf 317, Page: 279 -->
  
  has exhibited the same fondness for the water, and
peculiar feats in it, from the first time that it was
tried, when only a year old.


24th.—A governor of one ofthe Malayan districts

has been charged with oppressing the people for his
own aggrandizement. Not satisfied with punishing
the guilty, they have seized his wife, children, and
relatives, and doomed them all to slavery and chains
for life. This case of unrighteous dealing is by no
means singular. The Siamese have lately been
engaged in a war with some of the Malay tribes in the
Peninsula, and, owing to their superiority in numbers
and equipments, have conquered their enemies and
plundered the country. It is said that as many as
five thousand prisoners—families, as well as fathers
—have been sent as slaves to Siam. I visited a
company of them to-day, and was shocked at their
condition : young and old, high and low, were huddled
together like swine; filthy, diseased, some of them
extremely ill, destitute of nourishment, medicine, and
care. They were serving out a coarse kind of rice to
them, by a careful and parsimonious measurement,
without allowing them any seasoning to give it a
relish, or even fuel to cook it.


25th.—My visits to the prince have been suspended
for some time, on account ofthe death of an aunt who
was living with him. On these occasions all the
servants and subjects are obliged to have their heads
shaved. To-day he took me to see the style in which
<!-- Leaf 318, Page: 280 -->
the body is preserved, and witness some ofthe
ceremonies preparatory to its being burned. It is
partially embalmed; in a sitting posture; with the feet
drawn up, and the elbows between the knees. The
shrine, or case in which it is preserved, is constructed
like a pyramid, and decked with canopies and other
ornaments. The priests were present, and had been
repeating their prayers in a funereal tone of voice. At
six in the evening twenty-four drums were beat, and
trumpets blown—to frighten away the evil spirits,as I
suggested, in the way of interrogation; but from mere
custom, as my quick-sighted informant replied. He
admitted, however, that they did believe they could
drive away evil spirits; though guns, and not drums,
were the proper instruments.


Their superstition with respect to these demons is
extreme. He declares that they are frequently seen
and heard and felt, inflicting deadly diseases upon
persons. They have even the power, as he and the
whole nation suppose, of introducing into the body
substances too large and hard to be digested. "You
hear a noise generally upon the wall where you are
sleeping. If you start and inquire the cause, the
object is immediately introduced through the mouth;
if you lie still and maintain silence, they cannot
administer the fatal dose." This art is also ascribed to
men, who by their magic can reduce pieces of leather
and other substances to an almost imperceptible size,
and, after being combined with food or medicine,
<!-- Leaf 319, Page: 281 -->
and swallowed, can make them return to their original
form. This they declare has been satisfactorily
proved by a post-mortem examination. I have
heard the same from the Chinese, who stand in dread
of many of the Siamese, believing that they can
engage malicious spirits on their errands of death, and
that they often do so to avenge a private animosity,
or to gain other objects. Very recently the brother
of the Prah Kiang, who frequently took his place in
commercial transactions with foreigners, died. We
all suspected, from the slightness ofthe indisposition,
and the suddenness of the death, that it must have
been occasioned by ignorance or design in the native
doctors. When the body was burnt, those who were
present testified that a large piece of flesh was found
unconsumed in the fire, which they knew must have
produced his decease. This flesh was taken,
distributed among the relatives, and eaten, under the
impression that none who have employed this
preventive can ever be destroyed by the same means.
Among other witnesses, a little artless lad, son ofthe
Prah Kiang, told my friend Mr. Hunter of this fact,
and exhibited strong feelings of disgust when he
declared that they had made him eat part of the flesh.
The priests, it is said, by much praying have the
controul of these spirits, or at least are beyond their
controul, which furnishes a probable clue to the origin
and object of the superstition.  
  
  
  October 2d.—Yesterday and to-day I have been
<!-- Leaf 320, Page: 282 -->
visiting the Malay captives. The place was the same
as before, but the company was different, and their
numbers increased. It is quite sickening to witness
their misery. Some of them had died; others were
apparently in the last stage of existence; multitudes
were ill, none of whom had comforts adapted to their
wants; and many of them, especially the children,
exhibited such a painful expression of countenance
as made the heart bleed. We supplied some of them
with mats to keep them from lying on the cold
ground. I was happy to learn that their measure of
rice, though of the most inferior quality, had been
enlarged, and a little dried fish added to their
allowance; but, oh, what a fare for the emaciated bodies
and squeamish appetites ofthe diseased !


To-day I took such medicines as I thought might
be serviceable, but was disappointed to find that
the greater part of yesterday's company had been
removed. Among the objects of pity was a mother,
whose child had been torn from her, and was about
to be sent to a distant part of the kingdom. She
was almost frantic; sometimes falling on her knees
before those who had the management ofthe business,
begging them to restore her child; then running to
the boat which they were pushing from the shore,
and crying out after the object of her affections, in
the most impassioned manner. No notice was taken
of her; the boat moved off', and she was left to the
painfulness of, in all probability, an eternal separation.
<!-- Leaf 321, Page: 283 -->
We asked those to whom the poor woman appealed
for pity, why they did not attend to her. They
replied, that they had received their orders, and were
afraid to disobey them.


October 7th.—To-day our number exceeded twenty
by one or two. In the evening the priest called,
and returned three volumes of the word of God,
which he had taken to copy. Not knowing whether I
should ever have another opportunity for private
conversation with him, and feeling a strong interest in
his eternal welfare, I spoke as freely as I could on the
importance of having the heart interested in those
truths which he had taken some pains to learn. I
mentioned that his was the simple knowledge of the
head, which could be of no avail toward his salvation,
as long as the affections were unmoved, and his
idolatry retained. By a word or two, and a very
significant gesture, he made me to understand that
the fear of decapitation was the great preventive to a
change of faith. I told him what the Saviour said to
his disciples, about not fearing those who could only
kill the body, and that thousands, for the love of
Jesus and eternal life, had been transported on fiery
chariots to heaven.


His case reminds one of the priests in the Saviour's
day, who, it is said, believed, but did not confess
him openly, for the same reason. I think there
is little doubt that if a change of circumstances
should dissipate these fears, he would be among the
<!-- Leaf 322, Page: 284 -->
first in the kingdom to embrace Christianity. Alas
that such a change of circumstances should be at all
necessary!


14th.—Since the commencement of our Sabbath
service I have never seen such fixed and
thoughtful attention as was apparent towards the close
of this morning's exhortation. The Spirit of the
living Saviour was doubtless in our midst, and the
hearts of many, I sincerely believe, felt His sacred
presence. Again the sadness of separation came over
my spirit, and again I commended this little band
to ". the Shepherd and Bishop of souls." The more
we labour for the heathen, the more do we see the
necessity of labouring with our own hearts. It is
difficult to say which is the most painful, to toil with no
encouragement, or to leave unaccomplished the most
encouraging labours. If there were others to take
the place of those who are compelled to retire; or if
the flock from whom their pastor is removed had
attained to strength; the trial would be comparatively
light. To labour with patience, perseverance,
expectation, and prayer, is not sufficient for the comfort ofthe
instrument; he must learn to have his spirit so attuned
that the animating strain " I can do all things through
Christ, which strengtheneth me," may allow of the
interlude, "Not my will, but thine, be done."


During the past week I have supplied the Burman
camp with tracts in their own language. The books
were well received both by priests and people.
<!-- Leaf 323, Page: 285 -->

24th.—I have been informed, upon good authority,
that the Roman Catholics in China have been
reinforced this year by a bishop and four missionaries;
and in Siam by one missionary. The Viceroy of
Saigon, in Cochin-China, who was very favourable to the
Roman Catholic religion, and a man of vast power in
the kingdom, has lately died, which has produced
such apprehensions among the priests with respect to
their safety, that they have begged the Bishop of Siam
to offer up public prayers for their preservation*.
The same authority states the number of Christians
in Corea to be about ten thousand. They have no
European priests, but are supplied by natives from
China. A bishop and several missionaries are about
to be appointed.


The most prevalent languages employed by the
natives and foreign residents at Siam, are the Siamese
and Chinese. The spoken language of the Siamese
is simple and nervous; the written, quite the reverse.
Like the Chinese, there is a great deal of tone in their
ordinary pronunciation, but, unlike many dialects of
that language, the sense is not determined by the
accent. These modulations of voice are heard more
distinctly in reading, when you perceive that there
are three keys, a number of notes apart, through
which they pass by rules which I believe custom
alone regulates, and teaches with great precision. In  
  
  
  * They have since suffered severe persecution.
<!-- Leaf 324, Page: 286 -->
books, they are exceedingly fond of epithets, turgid
phrases, and a certain correspondence of sound in
words and members of sentences. The object of
language is often entirely forgotten. Instead of being
regarded as the vehicle of thought, they appear to
consider it as superior to all sentiment, often
multiplying expressions without the least additional force
or variation to the ideas. The majority of their books
contain little besides this pompous display of verbiage.
A number of works have been written in the Siamese
language : some of them treat of anatomy, medicine,
law, and other sciences; but a large proportion are
novels and fables, as full of absurdities and puerilities,
as the former are destitute of truth and utility. There
is scarcely any difference in the mode of speaking the
language throughout the kingdom : the tones vary
a little, but so little that all understand each other
with perfect facility.


The Bali, or Pali, is the sacred tongue of Buddh,
and is studied by the priests. Many Pali words are
introduced in their writings. The court language is
chiefly Cambodjian. The first legislator was from
Cambodjia, and, though he lived nearly twelve
centuries ago, the language remains unchanged. The
common era of Siam is the commencement of his
political career.


The language of Cambodjia is very different from
the Siamese. The Cambodjians employ the Pali
character in their moral writings, but have another for
<!-- Leaf 325, Page: 287 -->
ordinary subjects. The Laos appears more a dialect
of the Siamese than a distinct tongue, though the
characters of the two languages are somewhat
different. Between the Burmese and Siamese there is
scarcely any resemblance.


The most common colloquial dialect of the
Chinese in Siam is the Tay-chew, or Teo-chew. It
resembles the Fokien dialect more than any other, but
still differs so much from it, both in phrases and
accent, that, without a mutual understanding, there
can be but little intercourse between the natives of
the two places. There is not the same fulness and
distinctness of sound in the Tay-chew dialect as in
the other. The consequence is, that it is more
difficult to acquire, and especially to employ so as to be
intelligible to the natives. This may be owing,
however, to the great want of uniformity among
themselves; as also to the fact that they are poorer
and less instructed than the inhabitants of Fokien,
and, consequently, if you do not happen to strike the
very term and tone which they employ, they have no
means of gathering your idea.


There is nothing in a missionary's labour which
tries his patience and power of application so much
as these difficult and different languages. No effort
of genius can overcome the obstacles which he
continually meets with. There is, it is true, a talent for
languages, which gives immense advantages to those
who possess it, but the acquisition of the Chinese
<!-- Leaf 326, Page: 288 -->
depends upon a close imitation of writings which can
scarcely be said to be governed by any principles,
and in which the idiom is totally different from any
thing known or employed among western nations.
First, a knowledge of the character must be acquired,
and then you must pore over the books in which these
numerous characters are employed, until you perceive
how they are combined to convey different ideas.
Tbe man who has the most extensive acquaintance
with their classical and historical works, who can
servilely imitate their style, and liberally quote their
sentiments, is the literary man in China, and of
course the one best calculated to influence and
controul the mind of the empire. It is the untiring
exertion required i-n mastering these difficulties, together
with the effects of a climate unfavourable to close
mental application, which has injured the health of
the greater number of those who have devoted
themselves to this mission. This fact, however, should
not discourage any who feel it to be their duty to
consecrate their lives to the salvation of these nations.
The chief difficulties belong rather to the literature
of the language, than to a knowledge of it sufficient
for useful purposes. The colloquial dialects, though
they all require attention, may yet be obtained
without injury to the health, and without that application
of mind which is necessary for literary purposes. To
live with them, or have them live with you—to talk,
though you blunder—to question, though you cannot
<!-- Leaf 327, Page: 289 -->
understand the answer—to repeat or even write down
what you hear, and inquire about what you are
ignorant of—to dismiss all pride, all diffidence, and to lay
every man and every thing under contribution to your
object—this is the best way to study languages, and a
way which confines no one to his desk. It is an
important rule, never to be ashamed of your ignorance,
nor backward to ask even about what you ought to
know; and no plan have I found so profitable as
employing the pencil in catching words and sentences
from the lips of those who are talking, and then, if it
seems too unreasonable to make the man his own
interpreter, to defer the inquiry to a future period. I
have known one or two ladies whose health was
delicate, who had yet made themselves such proficients
in Chinese, that they could converse on all subjects,
and read and explain Christian books with facility *.
Still there is no other language in the East, probably
no other in the world, so difficult to be completely
acquired as the Chinese. The Siamese, especially
the spoken language, is by no means appalling. The
Malayan, employed in the Straits and throughout the
islands, is simplicity itself. It is doubtful whether
there is another language in the world which can be
so quickly understood and employed by foreigners of
all nations.  
  
  
  November 4th.—In the expectation of leaving the


* Being familiar with the subjects, these books are more easily
comprehended by us than their own.  
  
  
  o
<!-- Leaf 328, Page: 290 -->
place before this day, I had made arrangements for
those who were disposed to continue the Sabbath
services, to meet in future in the same place and at the
same hour. All whom I had any reason to expect
came, and these brought others with them, so that the
number was as great as usual. Having, in the
presence of all, mentioned the person by whom I desired
that the exercises should be chiefly conducted, I
resigned the office to him, and sat as a listener. The
audience were very silent and attentive, and the
expounder animated and happy in his views and
illustrations. It was very evident to me, that, exclusive
ofthe obligations which would probably bind a greater
number to me than to the substitute or to their own
best interests, the change is in many most important
respects desirable. In power of language he has
greatly the advantage—at least in his own dialect,
which is more familiar to the others, and less so to
myself, than the Fokien. His knowledge is extensive—
the result evidently of much reading, and I hope of
spiritual illumination. Besides, he knows their
modes of thinking and reasoning on moral subjects,
and the objections they entertain against
Christianity, which have been often urged against his faith,
but which they are more backward to express in my
presence *.


* In a communication from Mr. Jones, the Baptist missionary
who arrived shortly after I left the country, he mentions, under
date of September 22d, 1833, that this little assembly continue
<!-- Leaf 329, Page: 291 -->

It was my intention, before leaving Siam, to have
visited other parts of the kingdom. Juthia, the
ancient capital, and Chantibun, situated on the coast
towards Cochin-China, are places containing a large
population, and presenting many facilities for
missionary labour. I have frequently conversed with
those who were acquainted with these parts of the
country, and, from all that I could gather, they
appeared to be inviting and important spheres for
Christian exertion. At Juthia, probably at Chantibun
also, the Roman Catholics have missionaries. It
might be a little difficult at first to obtain access to
these places, as the Siamese resemble some of their
neighbours in jealousy and timidity; but time would
no doubt soon remove their suspicions, and open the
way to every part of the kingdom.

their worship, and that twenty were present on the preceding
Sabbath. In another letter, dated December of the same year, he
says, " Our little assembly of Chinese still continues, conducted by
Bunty, as usual. We have for some months had as good evidence
as I could expect, that two or three of his associates were true
converts, but, owing to my ignorance of their language, and their slight
acquaintance with Siamese, I had hitherto declined their repeated
solicitations for baptism. At length circumstances were such that
I did not feel at liberty to decline any longer, and on Sabbath
morning, the 8th inst., I administered the rite to Chek Bunty,
Chek Peng, and Chek Seang-seah."

  CHAPTER XIII.  
  
  
  PASSAGE FROM SIAM.

On Monday morning, November 5th, Mr. Hunter
called for me in a barge, and took me to the schooner
in which I was going to Singapore, and which was
lying outside the bar. The schooner was chartered
by him, and to his influence, and the kindness of
Captain Norris, I was again indebted for a passage
without expense. The vessel was less than a hundred
tons in burden, and four of us were obliged to stow
away in a very small cabin. Nothing peculiar
occurred on the passage, except that vve were near
getting on a lee shore, through the inattention ofthe
helmsman. Supposing that we were running in a line
with the Peninsula, we descried land immediately
before us, and were obliged to beat some time against
a head sea, before we felt it safe to bear away. Had
the wind been powerful, and the sea high, or had we
not enjoyed the advantages of day-light, the result
would probably have been different.


November 23d.—Ivisited a Borneo proa, in
company with Mr. Thomsen, to obtain information
respecting that island, and to distribute books. The
<!-- Leaf 331, Page: 293 -->
principal man, with whom we conversed, was very
intelligent and communicative. He belonged to
Benjar-Massin, about which place and the other Dutch
settlements, Sambas and Pontiana, he seemed to
possess much knowledge. He represents the Dyaks
residing near the settlements, and in the interior, as
exceedingly numerous. Formerly they were all very
ferocious; but the character of many of them has
been in a measure meliorated by intercourse with
foreigners, and perhaps by some little sense of fear,
as well as of the profit resulting from this
connexion. This applies principally, if not exclusively,
to those who reside near the station. He says there
are thousands of Chinese in the vicinity ofthe mines
which abound in the interior—a fact fully confirmed
by Europeans who have visited these places.


On Wednesday, November 28th, Mr. Thomsen
and myself left Singapore for Rhio in the ship
Dedierika, Captain Townsend, who went out of his way to
accommodate us, and would receive nothing for our
passage. Owing to calms, we were nearly three
days in accomplishing what we expected to perform
in twenty-four hours. Our object was to visit Mr.
Wenting, the Dutch missionary, and to distribute
books among the Malays and Chinese. We found a
few thousand of each residing in Rhio and the

neighbourhood.

Mr. W. occupies a small island by himself, which,  
  
  
  with others in the vicinity, was formerly infested by
<!-- Leaf 332, Page: 294 -->
pirates. It was given by the Dutch authorities tothe
Netherlands Society, on condition that their
missionaries should make it their abode. The house is
situated upon its highest eminence, commanding an
enchanting prospect, and exposed to every cooling
breeze. The islet contains between one and two
hundred acres of land. Besides the variety of its own
surface, chequered with lofty trees and native
dwellings, the touches of culture, and the wildness of the
jungle, you behold stretching beyond it an expanse
of water, bounded on the whole horizontal range,
with the exception of one opening, by numerous
islands—here retiring behind each other, so as to
disclose merely their promontories; and there
stretching in bold continuity to an immense extent; in some
places so near that almost every object may be
defined, and in others so distant that you can discern
nothing but their azure outline. About eight miles
off appears the small town of Rhio, with its few
European buildings and hill-crowned fort; on one
side of which is a Chinese settlement, on the other a
Malay campong, and in front, the harbour with ships
and native proas. The only part ofthe horizon not
bounded by hills, is the usual passage through which
vessels enter and leave the harbour of Rhio, and pass
and repass from Batavia, Singapore, and other places
among these islands.


On the island there are about thirty Malays, whom
Mr. Wenting teaches in a little airy chapel built on
<!-- Leaf 333, Page: 295 -->
another hill. We spent our time chiefly at Rhio,
and were very hospitably entertained by one of the
Dutch military officers. From the hill at Rhio,
where the Europeans reside, the prospect is nearly
equal to the one described. Among the peculiarities
of the vegetable kingdom, we found the sensitive
plant running wild upon the hills. A sweep of the
hand or foot among its luxuriant tendrils scattered
apparent death around; but a few moments shewed
it to be merely apparent, for life and beauty were
soon restored. We returned to Singapore in one of
the small Government vessels, manned with natives,
and fitted up to guard the sea from pirates.


January 18th, 1833.—Yesterday, at half past nine
in the morning, I had the mournful satisfaction of
witnessing the departure of my beloved Christian
brother, the Rev. Robert Burn, chaplain of
Singapore. I feel thankful to have had the privilege of
attending his sick bed for about a month and a half,
and of receiving and endeavouring to communicate
such lessons as fit the dying to depart in peace, and
the surviving to live with profit.


Mr. Burn was an ornament to the ministry. In
him were united some of the rarest qualities of
intellect and heart. In the private circle and in the pulpit
he often manifested such efforts of genius and
judgment as are seldom combined. His views of Divine
truth were uncommonly expansive and consistent;
and what gave them a double charm and
<!-- Leaf 334, Page: 296 -->
impressiveness, was the tenderness and humility of spirit which
they had produced in himself. His judgment was
too unbiassed, and his experience too comprehensive,
to consider as important those trifling points which
divide into parties the Christian church. He had his
peculiar views and predilections, but in his intercourse
with those of other sects they were never obtruded,
and in his ordinary conversation they were seldom
mentioned. Wherever he saw the image of Jesus, he
acknowledged a brother. Missionaries of every name,
and from every country, were welcomed to his house;
and while he gladly co-operated with them in their
missionary labours, he availed himself of all their
aid in his own sphere of duty. " Such Christian
magnanimity how rare! " and yet how conducive to
the interests of all parties—the salvation of a world—
the glory of an undivided Saviour!


But there was another peculiarity in this beloved
brother, which not only won the hearts of all who
knew him, but perhaps more than any thing else
improved those other traits of character in which he
excelled. He was not simply an Apollosin the
Scriptures, but an Israel in prayer. Before I had the
pleasure of his acquaintance, he was described to me
as one who appeared ready under all circumstances
to " fall upon his knees before God; " and the first
time, and the last, and every time, I heard him give
utterance to the sanctified impressions and desires
of his own heart, it exceeded every expectation I had
<!-- Leaf 335, Page: 297 -->
formed. Such a fervourand confidence of spirit; such
power in employing the arguments which a covenant
God has furnished, and which He cannot resist; such
a tender concern for all his friends, his scattered
brethren in Christ, and his perishing fellow-sinners in
every place; I believe is rarely exhibited—scarcely
ever surpassed. The admiration of all who ever heard
him pray, is uniform. God grant that many such
spiritual wrestlers may adorn and bless the church !


In his own estimation he was below all things—
none so unqualified for his office, so unfaithful in the
discharge of its responsible duties. He could weep
and tremble when this was the theme, and wish that
he might escape from the station he so miserably
filled, and shrink away into his beloved retirement—
an unknown obscurity. This was well, as far as it
respected its influence on his own spirit; but it
evidently limited his usefulness. That which he most
deplored upon his bed of death was the singular
aversion, which he had felt from infancy, to mingle
in society, or be made at all conspicuous. I never
knew such diffidence connected with such powers of
intellect. He was almost paralyzed at confronting
those with whom he was not intimate, and in
proportion to the part he was expected to sustain in their
presence. This characteristic, though springing from
humility, proved a detriment to his extensive
usefulness.  
  
  
  o 5
<!-- Leaf 336, Page: 298 -->

It was our earnest desire, and not without some
grounds of expectation, that this sickness might not
be unto death, but for the glory of God, in the
eminent devotion of His servant's future course. Many,
attacked by the same complaint, and under the same
treatment, had recovered; and it was not until he
sunk under a severe collapse, that the thought of
dying was admitted with any seriousness to our
minds. We were much together, both waiting for
the first favourable opportunity to embark for
England. The evening of the sudden change which
decided in our minds his earthly destiny, I was with
him until a late hour. We engaged in devotion as
usual, and separated for the night without the
least expectation of his near departure. The next
morning the news came that he had passed a night
of extreme illness, and would probably not survive
the day. Agonized by the unlooked-for change, I
hastened to his bed-side; but though he recognised
me, and expressed his full knowledge of his
approaching end, his mind soon lost its balance. At first he
was agitated. It was a midnight summons, and we
were all slumbering; but when he trimmed his lamp,
and found his vessel replenished—nay, when he
looked up, and beheld the Bridegroom—he recovered
from the shock, and became composed. From this
change, which preceded his departure about three
days, he was generally in a state of delirium, and
<!-- Leaf 337, Page: 299 -->
continued unconscious of his situation, until his spirit
was released from its prison, and admitted into ". the
joy of his Lord."


Eternity probably never appeared so much a
reality, a present reality—never did the glories of
heaven so powerfully possess the minds of the few
who stood around this departing brother—as at the
moment when we believed he awoke from utter
unconsciousness to the enjoyment of his Saviour's
perfect likeness and fruition. Oh how solemn was
the place ! We felt that the King of Saints and his
ministering angels were with us; and as we
committed the spirit in silence to the favour of its
covenant God, a thrill of rapture chased away the anguish
with which we had been oppressed. One of our
number was the bereaved companion whom he held
most dear in life, and whose delicate frame and
sensitive heart were wonderfully sustained in this hour of
overpowering sadness, and overpowering joy. Another
was a friend * who had ministered most kindly to his
wants, and from beneath whose hospitable roof he
took his heaven-ward flight. God grant that we
may all live under the impressions of that hour—
then shall we not live in vain.


Mr. Burn was the son of Major-General Andrew
Burn, whose interesting Memoirs are before the
Christian public. Besides his afflicted widow, he has  
  
  
  • T. Oxley, Esq., surgeon of the station.
<!-- Leaf 338, Page: 300 -->
left a brother in the ministry, and six sisters, to mourn
their loss, though they can all rejoice in his gain.
Like Henry Martyn, his chief inducement in
accepting a chaplaincy to the East was the desire of
usefulness among the heathen. He had a considerable
acquaintance with two of the languages of the
country, and wrote several Christian works in one of
them. May his example stimulate many, who occupy
similar stations in India, and beyond the Ganges,
and whose influence and exertions are much needed
for the conversion of the heathen nations *.


May 20th.—During the illness of Mr. Burn, and
after his decease, my health was sufficiently strong
to admit of my occupying his place in the duties of
the chaplaincy. Such was the beneficial influence
of the change of place upon my constitution, and
such the effect of the preached word, that I decided
on deferring my departure, until I should see whether
it was absolutely necessary to leave these scenes of
labour, and diminish still more the small number of
missionaries in the field. The trial of parting with
friends and country is great, but the necessity of
leaving the heathen world, where millions are
perishing without instruction, especially when at allqua
* The inhabitants of Malacca (writes a friend of Mr. Burn)
must long remember him with affection. Whenever his
ministerial duties called him to that station, he never failed to address
them publicly once or twice a week. He was also a liberal
supporter of the schools. From the time they were first established
until the Lord was pleased to take him to his rest, he annually set
apart between sixty and seventy pounds for their support.—Ed.
<!-- Leaf 339, Page: 301 -->
lifted for usefulness, is much more painful to him
whose heart is fully interested in his work.


In the discharge of the duties of the chaplaincy.
the study of languages, and some external labours
among the Chinese, my time was occupied for four or
five months. I attempted to supply every Chinese
family in the place with Christian books; but, while
engaged in the task, my health again yielded to the
influence of the climate, and I was obliged to leave
half, perhaps two-thirds, ofthe work unaccomplished.
A change of air and scene within the tropics may
prove useful to an invalid, but it rarely restores a
debilitated constitution, and generally loses all its
influence after a season.


During my residence at Singapore I became
acquainted with nearly all the European families in the
place, and received from many of them the most
polite and kind attentions. Especially was I
indebted to Mr. and Mrs. Thomsen, of the mission
family; and Messrs. Oxley and Diggles, under whose
hospitable roof I spent the greater part of my time.
I was not only the guest but the patient of the former
gentleman, and received at his hands the greatest
benefits*.


* Many changes have occurred at Singapore since I first visited
the place : the death of Mr. Burn; the marriage of Miss Martyn,
by which the Chinese schools have suffered an irreparable loss, at
at least for some time; and very recently the removal of Mr. and
Mrs. Thomsen, the only missionaries in the station, on account of
ill health. The chaplaincy has been supplied by Mr. Darrah,
who with the assistance of Mr. Thomas Scott, a young gentleman
<!-- Leaf 340, Page: 302 -->

Saturday evening, May 25th, 1833, I embarked
in the Cambridge, Captain Barber, for England. The
want of multiplied comforts and medical attendance,
only to be enjoyed in large ships, and quite
indispensable in my precarious state of health, determined
my choice, or rather precluded all choice, in the
selection of a vessel. A few days after leaving
Singapore we made the coa6t of Borneo, and kept that
island in sight for nearly a week.

engaged in commerce, has resumed some of the schools. I am
happy to find that the American Board of Foreign Missions have
recently occupied this field, and intend making Singapore their
principal station in these countries. The printing apparatus, having
fonts in two or three languages, has been purchased, and
missionaries sent forth.

  CHAPTER XIV.  
  
  
  ISLANDS OF THE ARCHIPELAGO—BORNEO.

With a single exception, Borneo is the largest island
in the world. It is more extensive than any
kingdom of Europe, and, although a wilderness, and a
vast haunt of savage beasts and men, it possesses
capabilities of culture and decoration, traffic, health,
and wealth, which are scarcely surpassed by any
locality in eastern Asia. The island is described
by one* who travelled six hundred miles into the
interior, and visited Bagottan, Passier, and Coti, as
"equal in climate, and superior in productions, to
any part of Asia he had seen or heard of." This
gentleman had visited many of the best parts of
India, and was, on this account, the more capable of
estimating its relative value.  
  
  
  The coast throughout its whole circumference is in


* J. Dalton, Esq., from whose interesting journal these remarks
are principally taken, and whose extensive observations have
generally confirmed the reports of other writers. At Singapore, where
Mr. D. lived and died, and where his journal was published, his
authority is relied on. In some other places, where neither the
man nor the subjects upon which he treats are at all known, it has
been questioned.
<!-- Leaf 342, Page: 304 -->
the possession of foreign settlers, who have
established themselves there at successive periods, and who
claim the right of possession, as a privilege attached
to their commercial and physical importance. Bugis,
Malays, Chinese, and Cambodjians, have each
retained a footing. The Dutch are the only European
power who have preserved their settlements. The
whole ofthe interior, from within a few miles of the
extreme point of Salatin on the north to Sooloo on
the south, from near Pontiana on the west to Coti
on the east, is in the possession of the Dyaks, the
aborigines ofthe island *.


Owing to their intercourse with more civilized
strangers, the natives who live in the vicinity of the
coast differ materially in their spirit and habits from
their brethren in the interior. They are represented
as tractable and mild in disposition, but so stupid or
pusillanimous as to submit to every indignity without
resistance. They are subject to Moslem chiefs, who
have established themselves on the banks ofthe rivers,
and who of course do all they can to extend their
authority. The mass of the natives under these
sultans remains unconverted to the Mahommedan faith.


The population of the interior is cut up into
innumerable tribes, who either associate together for
the sake of pillage and mutual protection, or maintain


* It is said there are other savages in Borneo distinguished by
other names than Dyak, though very like them in appearance and
habits.
<!-- Leaf 343, Page: 305 -->
a separate independence. The smaller rivers are
generally in the possession of a distinct tribe; the larger
ones, whose banks are sufficiently extensive, are
inhabited by a number of them. They are described as
bearing a general resemblance to each other, and being
very unlike all their neighbours. For symmetry of
form, strength and agility of muscle, and the most
unyielding courage and endurance, the aborigines of
Borneo claim a high distinction among their
fellowmen. The friendly disposition expressed by some of
their most powerful tribes towards Europeans,
presents an opening to foreign intercourse and influence;
while their active, sturdy habits, so different from
their Malayan neighbours, furnish a most promising
field of culture to the Christian philanthropist.


But, alas ! while this scene glows with moral beauty
in the distant perspective, the foreground is filled up
with every wreck and ruin of humanity. With respect
to the present state of the Dyaks, it would be difficult
—nay, impossible—to find their equals in all that
disgraces and degrades human nature. Others are far
below them in mental and bodily enervation, but we
read of none so debased in the scale of depravity.
In unprovoked, unrestrained barbarity, they exceed
the American Indian, the Charib, and the New
Zealander. How much they need the blessings of
Christianity may be gathered from their present mode
of life. War is their business, murder their pastime,
and the trophies of cruelty their proudest distinction.
<!-- Leaf 344, Page: 306 -->
Nothing is too high for their daring, nothing too
low for their despicable cruelty. All who belong not
to their confederacy are reputed enemies, whose heads
they endeavour to secure, at any hazard, and by any
means. The unfair and savage manner in which they
prosecute their warlike expeditions, or rather their
expeditions in search of human heads, is abhorrent
beyond all parallel. Insulated huts, defenceless
campongs, unwary fishermen, wretched stragglers, old
and young of either sex, are alike their prey. The
men and elder women are inevitably murdered; the
young women and children they seize for slaves.
In an expedition of Selgie, one of the most powerful
chiefs, which lasted for three months, they took seven
hundred heads. Such is the importance attached
to a warrior who possesses many heads, that he takes
his place in the presence of the Rajah with the air of
exalted worth; while those who are destitute of these
distinguishing trophies, are glad to creep into any
corner to escape notice.


Human heads grace the occurrence of every
important event. They are employed to celebrate a
Dyak's birth, and to consecrate his marriage; to
mitigate his diseases, and to appease his spirit after
death. Marriage is always referred to the Rajah,
who calls before him the young man and the father
ofthe girl. If the latter can produce ten heads, the
former must shew half the number, in the expectation
that when his age equals that of the other, the
<!-- Leaf 345, Page: 307 -->
emblems of their bravery will be alike. If the young
man is unable to produce the requisite number, he
summons a few friends, and sallies forth in search of
the deficiency, well aware that if he do not succeed
his lasting disgrace will be the consequence. Every
head is submitted to a close examination, and none
but those of recent victims are admissible. A part
of the ceremony consists in both parties taking a head
in each hand, and dancing round each other, with the
most extravagant gestures, amidst the applauses of
the Rajah and people. Upon the death of a chief,
the mound in which the body is deposited must be
studded with fresh heads, as the most acceptable
offering to the deceased. No warrior can presume to
make a visit of condolence to the family, without
bringing at least one head for the occasion. During
the first year or two, these heads are occasionally
changed. All kinds of sickness are supposed to be
under the influence of maligant spirits, whom nothing
can so well propitiate as human heads.


What mournful ravages must a custom so prevalent
and desolating spread throughout this vast island!
What numbers of victims are annually required for
such numberless purposes! What can prevent a total
and speedy extermination of all these ignorant, ill-fated
tribes, if Christian charity slumber much longer over
their appeals for mercy ? In their amusements, and
sometimes even in their domestic economy, the same
<!-- Leaf 346, Page: 308 -->
reckless disregard for human life is evinced. They
are extravagantly fond of cock-fighting, and stake
almost every thing they can command upon the game.
If the sum be lost, and not paid within twenty-four
hours, the winner has a legal right to dispatch his
debtor, and he generally does it. Upon an expedition,
if the Rajah's appetite craves fresh meat, and an
inferior animal is not at hand, one of his train is
butchered, and served up as a substitute. When the
men of wealth bury their treasure, which is a
common custom, they uniformly destroy the slaves who
assisted them, that the secret of the depository may
be confined to themselves.


It is difficult to determine what religious notions
the Dyaks entertain. They have no apparent dread
of dying. Their great and only fear is the loss of
these human heads, and this they deprecate more
than the majority in Christian lands do the loss of
their souls. Yet that there are evidently some
glimmerings of a future state in their darkened minds,
may be gathered from their burial rites, and from
other circumstances, which are grounded upon a
belief in the continued existence of the spirit. That
they have no idea of a retribution for their present
actions appears very evident from their brutal conduct,
unless they reverse all natural sentiments of right and
wrong, or believe that the awards of eternity are to
be thus reversed. Islamism, which has planted
<!-- Leaf 347, Page: 309 -->
itself upon their coasts, and succeeded in captivating
the Bugis, Malays, and neighbouring tribes, has not
been able to bow these sturdy spirits to its yoke.


It is said, by some of the older writers, that their
language contains many words common to the Malay
and the Sanscrit. They appear to have no written
characters, as Mr. D. met with but three men who
could write, and they had been taught the Bugis
language, and were regarded as prodigies.


Towards the centre, and inclining to the north, the
natives are described as still less tractable—roving
about the woods, naked and wild—neither dwelling in
huts, nor cultivating the ground, nor even associating
with each other. These miserable creatures are hunted
by the more civilized Dyaks as an amusement. Their
infant children, whom the mothers cradle upon the
pendant branches of trees, are shot like monkeys.
The captured men are of course beheaded, and the
women spared only when young. The children are
taken home and made their drudges. To prevent
their escape, which their masters declare is
invariable if entrusted with their liberty, they cut off a
foot, and stick the stump in a bamboo of molten
damar. This prevents their running, and secures
their services in paddling the boats.


The north and north-west coast has seldom, if ever,
been visited by Europeans. The Bugis and other
traders affirm that it is by far the richest part of the
island, containing a dense population, who carry on
<!-- Leaf 348, Page: 310 -->
an extensive traffic with Cambodjia and the
neighbouring islands. The Cambodjian language is as
much employed as any other. Near Pontiana are a
large number of Chinese, who work the mines, and
who are accessible to the Christian missionary. Mr.
Medhurst visited them a few years ago, and
published an interesting account of his tour.


Borneo might be immediately occupied as a
missionary field. Our ignorance prevents us from stating
very definitely its advantages for Christian enterprize.
No doubt there will be serious obstacles to the work,
and much self-denial and perseverance will be
necessary in its prosecution; still there are stations where
missionaries would be protected, and whence
encroachments might be gradually made upon the
interior, until the length and breadth of this extensive
land was possessed. The Romish Propaganda have
been addressed upon the subject by a child of that
church, who formerly resided upon the island; but
his Holiness, contrary to his usual vigilance and
promptness of action, has thus far neglected the
opportunity. The writer met the present Resident of
Pontiana at Batavia. He says the natives near the
foreign settlement are heartily sick of Mahommedan
tyranny, and would gladly exchange their faith to be
released from their masters. It is supposed that
there are about two or three hundred thousand Dyaks
in the vicinity of this station, besides twenty or
thirty thousand Chinese, and a number of Malays.
<!-- Leaf 349, Page: 311 -->
He appeared desirous that missionaries should be
sent, and would no doubt assist in their
establishment. Here, then, the first mission might be planted.
Sambas and Banjar-Massin, also in the possession
of the Dutch, will probably be found equally
accessible and inviting.


From Mr. Dalton's account, the natives of the
interior seem very desirous of cultivating an intercourse
with Europeans. Selgie, the most powerful chief in
the south-east division of the island, said that he
would even desist from the custom of cutting off
heads, and submit to Europeans in any thing, if he
could enjoy the advantages of their trade. Mr. D.
thinks a traffic with these people would be both
practicable and profitable. The rich productions of their
country might be received in exchange for the
superabundant articles of European growth and
manufacture. Though their object in wishing to form an
acquaintance with foreigners is purely secular
advantage, yet it proves that they are far from being
averse to Europeans, or wishing to keep aloof from
them : and if an honourable trade is to be a means of
introducing the Gospel, the time is no doubt
approaching when the heart of many a godly merchant
will leap at such an enterprize, and his swift ships
fly upon these errands of mercy.


It is not to be concealed that the pirates, which
infest some parts of the coast and the mouths of some
of the rivers, are numerous and desperate. Plunder
<!-- Leaf 350, Page: 312 -->
is their only object, force their only law, and
destruction the only quarter they shew; but they are chiefly
confined to the east and south-east coasts, and there
would be no necessity for going near their districts,
at least with vessels which would invite and could
not repel an attack.


There is a constant trade kept up between
Singapore and different parts of the coast; and the
missionary residing at the former place often visits
their proas, and supplies them with Christian books.
Here, then, is another opening through which the
Gospel might be introduced, not only in the way of
tracts, but by the visits of the living teacher. As in
the case of Mr. Dalton, these traders might be bound
to protect the missionary, by the strongest guarantee
they know of; and thus he might gain access, under
a security, which, independent of special protection
from on high, would afford comparative safety.
<!-- Leaf 351, Page: 313 -->
  
  CHAPTER XV.  
  
  
  CELEBES—SOOLOO.

C e lebes—a short distance east of Borneo—is another
island of much importance, and teeming with savage,
cruel inhabitants. It is remarkable for the martial
spirit, commercial enterprise, and piratical atrocities
of many of its inhabitants. The most prominent
nations are the Bugis, and Macassar, or Mengasar,
tribes. They speak different languages, or, more
properly, different dialects of the same language;
the written character being nearly the same. The
language of Goa or Macassar is peculiarly soft and
easy of acquisition, but not so copious as the Bugis—
the latter having embodied in their vocabulary a
greater number of foreign words. The literary
compositions in both are numerous. They consist chiefly
of historical details, written since the introduction of
Mahommedanism in the early part of the sixteenth
century, traditions of more early times, romances,
poetical compositions of love, war, and the chase.
They have a paraphrase of the Koran, and several
works translated, most probably, from the Javanese  
  
  
  p
<!-- Leaf 352, Page: 314 -->
and Arabic. Each particular state records its public
events as they occur.


These nations far surpass the Malays, and many
other of the neighbouring tribes, in intellectual
vigour, and various acquirements. Here then are
advantages for missionary labour, which are seldom
found among such otherwise barbarous creatures.
They have extended their commerce from the western
shores of Siam to the eastern coast of New-Holland.
Excepting the Arabs, they are the only traders of
consequence throughout this Archipelago. They
have the character of fair dealing in trade, but are
most determined pirates—preying especially upon
their weaker neighbours, the Malays, whom they
regard as their inferiors. The Mahommedan religion
prevails in the south-west, but in tbe north and
central parts of the island they are Pagans, or scarcely
have a religion at all. The aborigines of the island,
possessing the interior, are strikingly allied in
appearance and customs to the Dyaks of Borneo. They
are known by the same name. By the Dutch they
are called Alforees. The fondness of both for
cutting off heads is the same—their languages are
different.


Mandhaar, on the west coast of Celebes, was
visited by Mr. Dalton. The mountains are
stupendous, and can be seen at sea at the distance of a
hundred miles or more. For more than twelve miles
<!-- Leaf 353, Page: 315 -->
along the shore at the place where he landed, the
houses almost join each other. The people are in
general miserably poor, and live upon the meanest
fare. All the rice which they use is brought from a
distance of two hundred and fifty miles. None but
the chief people can afford themselves this luxury.
The inhabitants generally live upon sago, which,
though of a coarse quality, grows most luxuriantly,
and costs the indolence of the natives nothing but
the labour of collecting it. Cocoa-nuts of the most
delicious flavour abound. For the distance of seventy
miles the coast is adorned with cocoa-nut trees,
extending, in many places, to the base of the
mountains, half a mile from the shore. These constitute
a ehief article of trade, being exported in great
numbers to every part ofthe eastern coast of Borneo,
where very few are produced.


The common food ofthe inhabitants consists in a
great degree of shell-fish. These they take when the
tide ebbs. The shore is sandy, and the sea retires at
least four miles; at which time the whole population
is in motion, following the water as it recedes, and
picking up crabs and various kinds of craw-fish.
When the tide flows again, the different parties get
into their small canoes and paddle to their houses.
Fish caught in nets is eaten only by the wealthier
class, for, though very cheap, it proves too dear for
those who have nothing to purchase it with. The
only articles the common people are obliged to buy  
  
  
  P 2
<!-- Leaf 354, Page: 316 -->
are tobacco and salt; and to pay for these, all the
women and children of the community spend their
time in making sarongs, for which they obtain a
sufficient sum to procure the required articles, and to
furnish the master of the house with a small allowance for
gambling. The Rajah and his family, and all others
who can afford it, smoke great quantities of opium.
They are constantly in a state of stupidity, from the
effect of this drug, and refuse to see strangers until
time is given them to recover. They sell their
golddust, in which the Rajah and some of his brothers
are rich, for nothing but opium, muskets, swivels,
•and gunpowder.


Mamoodjoo, the principal campong in the district
of Mandhaar, is the residence of about forty Rajahs,
each of whom has a separate dominion in the interior,
although they prefer living together on the coast.
Their countries produce gold, of which they obtain
sufficient for their wants. Many of them appear to
possess a large quantity of this metal, and, although
cautious in every other kind of expenditure, they
willingly bring forth any amount to pay for the
means of carrying on their wars and piracies, and to
purchase enough of opium to keep them in a constant
delirium of intoxication.


From the point of Mandhaar to Kylie, including
that place, there are about fifty Rajahs, few of whom
have less than ten proas, and some upwards of a
hundred. The smallest of these carry one barrel of
<!-- Leaf 355, Page: 317 -->
gunpowder, the largest five; besides which they
always keep a quantity on shore. The large supply
of this article, in such constant demand, is smuggled
from Java, and obtained from American vessels near
Penang. Such is the miserable quality of the powder
sold to them by the Americans, who employ samples
of a good quality to deceive them, that it is necessary
to prime with another kind; and the muskets are
composed of such materials, that it is said, that
being shot at by them is nearly as safe as firing
them. Still these numerous pirates commit, at times,
dreadful ravages. Two Dutch vessels were taken by
them in 1828, and every soul on board murdered.
The inhabitants of Kylie are proverbial every where
for these atrocities. For the last twenty years the
Rajah has carried on his depredations in these seas,
and, besides his other captures, has taken many
Europeans, a few of whom, it is thought, are still
living in slavery in Borneo.


No part of Celebes, except Macassar, has been
conquered by Europeans. In Boni not a foot of
ground has been retained. Waagoo, or Waju, is still
less known. All the native states retain their
primitive greatness, and the most enlightened of them
have never been visited by Europeans. The writer
met a Dutch officer, who is, perhaps, the only
exception to the above remark. He had penetrated some
distance into the interior, and spoke very highly of
<!-- Leaf 356, Page: 318 -->
the intelligence and hospitality of one of the native
queens, whose district he had visited.


The northern parts of Celebes are inhabited by a
number of native tribes, who have never been
converted to Mahommedanism, and do not appear to be
wedded to any heathenish superstitions. They are
strongly attached to the Dutch, and acknowledge
them as their superiors and lords. They appear early
to have attracted the attention of the Christians in
Holland, and were furnished with a minister, who
baptized large numbers, and established among them
schools with native teachers. Still this promising
field was but scantily supplied with the means of
culture, and, during the ravages of the French
revolution, it was quite forgotten by the churches at
home. On the arrival of the first permanent
missionary of the new era, much interest was manifested
by the native chiefs, and the descendants of
Christians, to have schools re-opened among them. Such
were their predilections in favour of Christianity,
that in a few years more than six hundred persons
were admitted into the church. Some ofthe Rajahs
offered themselves as instructors of their own people.
In 1831, Messrs. Reidel and Schwartz, missionaries
of the Netherlands Society, arrived in the island.
After exploring the whole country, they fixed upon
two places for their permanent abode. Mr. Reidel
remains at Tondano, and Mr. Schwartz at Longowan.
<!-- Leaf 357, Page: 319 -->
These brethren are greatly encouraged by their
prospects of usefulness. The schools in the environs
of Manado are numerous and increasing, the church
prospers, and the Lord evidently blesses the labours
of his servants. " The Dutch government has
greatly aided the missionaries in the prosecution of
their work. There is also a spirit of improvement
in the external circumstances of the natives, which
ahvays accompanies the progress ofthe pure Gospel.
We shall soon hear more respecting the great things
which the Redeemer has done for these poor
islanders *."


Farther to the north lies the island of Sooloo, and
a small group known by that name. Though
comparatively limited in dimensions, Sooloo is represented
by Dampier as one of the most interesting islands
in this part of the world. It is celebrated for the
large quantity of ambergris thrown upon its shores,
also for its valuable pearl fishery. Besides these
sources of wealth, it abounds in wax, gold,
birds'nests, beche de mer, and other articles of traffic.
Writers differ about the number and character of its
inhabitants. All agree respecting the power of the
Sultan, whose dominions include the neighbouring
islands and part of the coast of Borneo. Some affirm
that it has " a vigorous government, a numerous fleet,
and an army of fifty thousand well-equipped men,  
  
  
  * Chinese Repository, vol. ii.
<!-- Leaf 358, Page: 320 -->
animated by superstition and united in hatred of the
Christian name." The Spaniards made two
successive attempts to reduce it to their authority, but were
repelled. In a third attack they gained possession,
but were soon obliged to abandon it. The fourth
and last effort resulted in their disgrace, and in a
successful reprisal made by the natives, and some of
their Mahommedan neighbours, who laid waste the
Spanish possessions for three years.


For the speedy conversion of the numerous tribes
inhabiting the islands of these seas,including the north
of Borneo, where Spanish influence is not felt, and
the Roman Catholic religion is not acknowledged,
we must call upon those who possess the means of
intercourse and traffic with the nations, and whose
invaluable talent, it is hoped, will be no longer laid
up in a napkin.
<!-- Leaf 359, Page: 321 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVI.  
  
  
  PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

About north-east from Sooloo is situated the
island of Mindanao—Magindanao of the charts. It
contains nearly as many square miles as the largest
of the Philippines. The Spaniards, in the zenith of
their glory, repeatedly attempted the subjugation of
this island as well as its neighbours, but were either
repulsed or soon obliged to abandon their dearly
gained possessions. In one expedition it is said they
did not even land, being appalled by the crowd of
armed natives who lined the shore. They did,
however, succeed in gaining a footing on its south-western
part, where they still have a small useless settlement.


The island is said to be peopled throughout by
an industrious race of men, many of them from the
shores of Cambodjia. The captain of a
CochinChina junk, who had frequently visited this island,
and those of the Sooloo group, declared that they
were as thickly populated as any part of northern
China. Mr. Dalton was informed that from
CochinChina, and the native states about the mouth of the
Cambodjia river, more than a hundred proas ofdifP 5
<!-- Leaf 360, Page: 322 -->
ferent sizes sailed directly to Mindanao, and that each
of them contained from fifty to five hundred
emigrants. Whether this be exaggeration or fact,
another writer affirms, that " the centre and southern
part of the island, and particularly the shores of its
numerous inlets and interior lakes, are crowded with
an immense population." " While vessels of
respectable size and force, trade without danger at these
places, depredations are often committed on the
defenceless, both by land and sea." The inhabitants
have a peculiar language, though they understand
the Malay. Their religion is Islamism.


To the west lies the island of Palawan, which is
also said to contain a dense population. Large
numbers of emigrants annually arrive, who are obliged to
spread themselves over other islands.


Magellan possesses much of the character of the
two already noticed.


Including these islands, and extending north to
the Bashee passage, is the Philippine group.
According to the authority of one * who resided some
time in Manilla, "the Spanish possessions extend from
the Batan islands on the north, to Mindanao on the
south, and from Paragua or Palawan on the west, to
the Mariani islands on the east; but their sovereignty
over all these limits is not equally full. The Batan
islands appear to be rather an ecclesiastical than a


L°i. T ?'ng' Esq* siomTwh°se manuscript, and a small work
published a few years ago in India, these extracts are taken.
<!-- Leaf 361, Page: 323 -->
■civil dependency. The Spanish possessions thus
defined, comprehend twenty-eight provinces, of the
greater part of which there are no published accounts.
They contain a population of three millions and a
half. These are generally found along the shores of
the sea, around the bays, and upon the banks of the
rivers; the interior of the larger islands being still a
dense forest. In the depths of these forests some
wretched aborigines still exist, the relics of tribes
dispossessed by their Malayan invaders."


In a volume published in India, and reviewed in
the Chinese Repository, it is said that in " situation,
riches, fertility, and salubrity, the Philippines are not
exceeded. Nature has here revealed, according to all
that poets and painters have imagined, the unbounded
luxuriance of Asiatic scenery. The lofty chains of
mountains, the rich and extensive slopes which form
their bases, the ever-varying change of forest and
Savannah, of rivers and lakes, the yet blazing
volcanoes in the midst of forests coeval perhaps with their
first eruption—all stamp the works of Deity with
the mighty emblems of His creative and destroying
power." Rice, sugar, coffee, cocoa, hemp, tobacco,
cotton, indigo, and many kinds of delicious fruit, are
among the articles of produce which render these
islands highly valuable.


Of the numerous inhabitants of the Philippines
but a few hundreds are Europeans, the remainder are
Negroes, Malays, Mestizos, and Creoles.
<!-- Leaf 362, Page: 324 -->

The Negroes are doubtless the original inhabitants
of the islands. They are small in stature, woolly
headed, and thick lipped; some black, and others of a
mulatto complexion. They live in low huts of canes,
sow rice, maize, potatoes, &c, and come down to the
neighbouring villages to exchange wax, deer, and the
fruits of the forest, for necessary articles. They are
divided into many tribes, and are distinguished by
peculiar habits and dialects. The most degraded of
them are described as " naked vagrants, without
home, without religion, with no other shelter than
that which the rocks and trees afford; satisfying the
cravings of hunger with wild fruits and unhealthy
roots; rarely using their bows on the abundant game
around them, though ready enough to draw them
against their fellow-men. Covered from head to foot
with loathsome scurf and eruptions, their longest life
rarely exceeds forty years. The oldest of them is
recognised as chief. They inter their dead with a
flint, steel, and tinder, a hatchet, and a piece of
venison; and the passenger is obliged to leave at the
grave a part of what he has obtained in barter, or
caught in the chase."


"The Malays, or Indians as they are called by the
Spaniards, appear to have emigrated to this country
at different times, and from different parts of Borneo
and Celebes. Those of the provinces are a
proudspirited race of men, possessing all the elements of
greatness, though for three hundred years they have
<!-- Leaf 363, Page: 325 -->
been ground to the earth by oppression, their spirit
tortured by abuse and contempt, and brutalized by
ignorance." The same writer describes the Indian
as " brave, tolerably faithful, extremely sensible of
kind treatment, and feelingly alive to injustice and
contempt; proud of ancestry, which some of them
carry back to a remote epoch; fond of dress and show,
hunting, riding, and other field exercises; but prone
to gambling and dissipation. He is active,
industrious, and remarkably ingenious. He possesses an
acute ear, and a good taste for music and painting,
but little inclination for abstruse studies. He has
by nature excellent talents, but these are useless
from want of instruction. The little he has received
has rendered him fanatical in religious opinions; and
long contempt and hopeless misery have mingled with
his character a degree of apathy, which nothing but
an entire change of system and long perseverance will
efface from it." This, however, does not exhibit the
worst features of the Indian character.


\"Under the name of Mestizos are included not
only the descendants of Spaniards by Indian women,
but also those of Chinese, who are in general whiter
than either parent, and carefully distinguish
themselves from the Indians. The Mestizos, with the
Creoles of the country, like those of all colonies when
nncorrected by a European education, inherit the
vices of both progenitors, with scarcely any of the
virtues of either. Their character has but few marked
<!-- Leaf 364, Page: 326 -->
traits. The principal ones are vanity, industry, and
trading ingenuity. Money is their god. To obtain it
thej* assume all forms, promise and betray, submit to
every thing, trample and are trampled on. All is
alike to them, if they can obtain their end. And
when their wishes are crowned, they dissipate their
wealth in law-suits, firing cannons, fireworks,
illuminations, processions on feast days and rejoicings, in
gifts to the churches, and in gambling. This
anomaly of action is the business of their lives. Too
proud to consider themselves as Indians, and not
sufficiently pure in blood to be acknowledged as
Spaniards, they affect the manners of the last with
the dress of the first, and, despising, are despised by
both. Such are the three great classes of men which
may be considered as natives ofthe Philippine islands.
The Creole Spaniards, or those whose blood is but
little mingled with Indian ancestry, pass as Spaniards.
Many of them are respectable merchants, and men of
large property, while others are sunk in all the vices
of the Indians and Mestizos."


"The Chinese residents retain here, as in every
place, their national character—active in business,
and not above its meanest minutiae; winning their way
by pliancy and presents; unprincipled in acquiring,
and gross and sensual in enjoying their gains. Their
close combination, and large share in the most
profitable and least laborious employments, have always
brought on them the envy and hatred of the Indians.
<!-- Leaf 365, Page: 327 -->
Upon the complaints of the latter, Government has
been led to treat them severely. Yet they have proved
themselves serviceable to the country and its other
inhabitants. Few of them are men of much property,
though doing a great proportion of the commercial
business of the country. They procure licences to
remain, receive baptism, become Roman Catholics,
intermarry, and hold property; but when able to return
to China, they appear not to regret leaving their
families and their faith behind. Their number is
probably twenty thousand, which is a mean between
the low official estimate and common opinion." Such
is the feeling of hostility towards the Chinese, that
they have had their commerce interrupted, have been
expelled from the island, and sometimes slaughtered
in great numbers.


\"That this highly favoured country should have
remained till the present day almost a forest, is a
circumstance which has generally excited surprise, and
has been attributed to the indolence of the Spaniards
and Indians; but this is a superficial view ofthe
subject. The true reason is, because there is no
security for property. Does an unfortunate Indian scrape
together a few dollars to buy a buffalo, in which
consists his whole riches?—woe to him if it be known,
and if his house stand in a lonely situation : he is
infallibly robbed. Does he complain, and is the
robber caught ?—in a short time he is let loose again,
to take vengeance on his accuser, and renew his
<!-- Leaf 366, Page: 328 -->
depredations. Hundreds of families are yearly ruined
in this way. The imperfect mode of trial, both in
civil and criminal cases, lays them open to a thousand
frauds."


That which, in the history'of these islands, is most
to be deplored, and which has been perhaps the
principal cause ofthe ferocity and treachery which in the
East characterize Manilla men*, is their religion.
"The Church of Rome has here proselyted to itself
the entire population. The natives have become
bigoted Papists. The services of the church are
administered by nearly one thousand frailes, curas,
cleros, &c.; the first offices being held by the Spanish
clergy." At the head of this colonial establishment
is an archbishop, who has three suffragans, and two
hundred and fifty Spanish clergy, besides about eight
hundred natives. The influence of these priests is
unbounded. They hold the minds of the miserable
natives in complete subjection, while they themselves
are the slaves as well as the patrons of iniquity.
Their ministrations are confined to the altar and the
confession-box. " Common report attributes to the
priests lives deformed with the grossest immoralities.
In the obscurity of their parishes, much concealment
to their licentious conduct is not attempted, nor have


* Such is the revengeful and sanguinary character of these men,
that it is said to affect the insurance of the ships in which they are
employed. The massacre of 1820 illustrates the ferocity of their
character.
<!-- Leaf 367, Page: 329 -->
the majority of them refinement enough to think it
becoming."


One source of vice and poverty among the
natives, is the number of religious observances
imposed upon them. "The church has marked out,
exclusive of Sundays, above forty days in the year,
on which no labour must be performed throughout
the island. Besides these, there are numerous local
feasts, in honour of the patron saints of towns and
churches. These feasts invariably end in gambling,
drinking, and debauchery of every description."


While the Spaniards retain the possession of these
islands, and the priests bear the rule, we scarcely see
how any efforts can be made for the spiritual welfare
of the natives. The importation of Bibles is strictly
prohibited. Every ship is searched, and the most
serious consequences might result to those who
incurred the displeasure, or even the suspicions, of the
priests. The city of Manilla, which contains some
forty thousand inhabitants, and is described as an
agreeable tropical residence, would be a most
advantageous post for missions. Let every Christian pray
that the power of the Beast may be destroyed, and
the sceptre of Jesus extended over these
perishingsouls.
<!-- Leaf 368, Page: 330 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVII.  
  
  
  LOO CHOO ISLANDS.

North-east from the Philippine islands is situated
the Loo Choo group, of which such interesting
accounts have been furnished both by European and
Chinese voyagers. There are about thirty-six of these
islands, subject to the same Government, though all
very limited in dimensions. The largest is only fifty
miles long, and twelve or fifteen broad. Like many
of the other islands described, some of these are
represented as beautiful spots. " From a commanding
height above the ships," says an English writer, " the
view is in all directions picturesque and delightful.
On the one hand are seen the distant lands rising from
a wide expanse of ocean; while the clearness of the
water enables the eye to trace all the coral reefs which
protect the anchorage immediately below. To the
south is the city of Napafoo—the vessels lying at
anchor in the harbour, with their streamers flying—
and in the intermediate space appear numerous
hamlets, scattered about on the banks of the rivers
which meander in the valley beneath. Turning to
the east, the houses of Kint-ching, the capital city,
<!-- Leaf 369, Page: 331 -->
built in their peculiar style, are observed, opening
from among the lofty trees which surround and shade
them, rising one above another in gentle ascent to the
summit of a hill, which is crowned by the king's
palace; the interesting grounds between Napoff and
Kint-ching—a distance of some miles—being
ornamented by a continuation of villas and
countryhouses. To the north, as far as the eye can reach,
the higher land is covered with extensive forests."
The climate is also said to be " one of the most
propitious in the world."


But it is not only the scenery and salubrity of these
islands which interest those who visit them. The
inhabitants themselves, though small in stature, and
effeminate in appearance, are uniformly described as
persons of great intelligence and address. Their
politeness exceeds, if possible, that of the Chinese: it
extends through all classes of society, and often leads
to such compliments and professions of friendship as
quite nonpluss the other party. " They shew more
good sense," says a visitor* whose knowledge of the
Chinese nation is extensive, " than we had ever seen
in China. By their questions respecting the trade
which several European nations carried on at Canton,
they discovered much geographical knowledge. They
were able to converse on politics with great
volubility."  
  
  
  We cannot, however, from the accounts ofsubse* Mr. Gutzlaff.
<!-- Leaf 370, Page: 332 -->
quent writers, fully confide in that high estimate of
their character which the first English visitors formed.
Owing to the novelty of their circumstances, they no
doubt acted an assumed part, and made every thing
appear to the best advantage before their polite guests.
Mr. Gutzlaff declares that " they did not hesitate to
tell us lies whenever it suited their purpose; but they
were as ready to retract what they had uttered. Upon
inquiry, we found that they had among them the
same severe punishments as at Corea; that they
possessed arms likewise, but are averse to using them."
Still, he, as well as all others, represent them as among
the finest specimens of unchristianized men.


From a Chinese account, it appears that one of
their ancient kings " laid the foundation of his
kingdom by military force; and that till this day there is,
in a temple dedicated to him, an arrow placed before
the tablets on which his name is inscribed, which
tradition says is in conformity with his dying will, to
shew that his kingdom was founded by military
prowess *."


According to this account, " the supreme power is
in the hands of the prime minister, who is absolute.
All affairs ofthe revenue, the designation ofthe army,
and the infliction of punishments, are under his
controul, although the form of reporting to the King, and
receiving his sanction, is observed." This accounts
for the idea suggested to Captain Maxwell, of having  
  
  
  * Indo-Chinese Gleaner, vol. ii.
<!-- Leaf 371, Page: 333 -->
the minister address the King of England. The letter
was declined, because it did not come from the Loo
Choo King. They have derived from China the
division of their officers into nine ranks; and they
have drawn up a compendium of law, from the Chinese
penal code.


The majority of the people, as in Japan,
understand the Chinese character, but do not know how to
read it in the Mandarin dialect. Their own language
seems greatly to resemble the Japanese. The
alphabetical writing is nearly of the same form, and the
letters, with a very few exceptions, are pronounced in
the same way. In imitation of the Chinese system,
district schools have been established by the King,
and the examination of students is conducted on the
same plan. The King gives them an occasional
banquet, by way of encouragement. They have set up
the image of Confucius, and study carefully the
commentary of Choo-foo-tsze. The readiness with which
they acquire a smattering of the English language,
evinces an uncommon share of intellect, as well as
of tact in its employment. " I was much surprised,"
says a visitor, " to find a person in such a spot speak
tolerable English, and was answered to my inquiries
on that subject, that an English ship had been at the
islands three years before, and remained a few days,
in which time he (the interpreter) had learned what I
now heard."  
  
  
  Their religion is that of Budha. They have none
<!-- Leaf 372, Page: 334 -->
of the sect of Taou-sze. There are nuns among them.
They had temples in the thirteenth century, the
foundations of which have long since disappeared.
They have imitated what they saw in China, and
have even imported her idols,—the queen of heaven
and others. According to their accounts, a priest of
Budha was driven on their island in a boat about
{empty}a.d. 1275 They knew not whence he came; but
he commenced a line of priesthood, which has been
kept up ever since. As in China, they have those
among them who pretend to point out propitious spots
for graves, though none of them profess to understand
astrology. There is every reason to believe, that, as
a nation, they care very little about their
superstitions. " When they heard that we did not worship
idols," says Mr. Gutzlaff, "they replied, 'We also
abhor this worship; those which you see here are the
property of the Budhists, and we do not batter our
heads against them.' This has been the general reply
of many Mandarins, when I inquired upon this
subject. They disavow practical idolatry, because their
reason disapproves of the theory; yet they do, in
fact, persevere in their unreasonable worship."


Their refusal to allow Europeans to trade, and the
pains they uniformly take to prevent intercourse with
strangers, have probably been dictated by their more
powerful neighbours. " We do not doubt," says the
writer already quoted, " that they have received strict
orders from China to keep strangers aloof, and to
<!-- Leaf 373, Page: 335 -->
treat them with distance and reserve; yet they were
too good-natured to confess it." If by dint of
persuasion, sour looks, or even lying, they can keep
foreigners from landing, it is always done. Their
reason for rejecting the application of the " Lord
Amherst" to trade, was because " their country was
poor, and unproductive of any thing which they could
give in exchange for our imports; that, besides, they
had never traded with the English, and therefore this
would be an innovation contrary to law." In this
case, however, they had those to deal with, who,
though they did not insist upon trading, were too
well acquainted with the nature of such prohibitions
to be frightened by them; and who, contrary to their
wishes and whims, landed when, and wandered where,
their inclinations prompted. They objected, as they
had done before, to the distribution of books; but
their objections were overruled by the same system of
apparent forwardness and unyielding perseverance
which had been adopted among the Chinese.


There is every reason to believe that here, as in
China, the people would be favourable to foreign
intercourse, and that all the opposition to it originates
with the Government. When the Mandarins were out

of the way, the people received books and presents
with great eagerness. " Whenever we gave any thing
privately, they would gladly accept it, though they
took the books in preference; but every thing openly
offered them was always declined. The practice of
<!-- Leaf 374, Page: 336 -->
medicine drew crowds of patients, who felt the
superiority of our medical skill, and received Christian
books with gladness."


The inquiry remains, in reference to these
interesting heathen, What shall be done, what ought to be
done, for their eternal welfare ? How shall these lovely
islands be reduced to the dominion of Christ ? Might
not ships visit them ?—might not their objections to
an honourable trade be annulled ?—ought we not to
distribute freely among them the written word ? And
who knows but that the living teacher might force
himself upon them, soon dissipate their groundless
fears, and prove to them the advantages of his
presence and influence ? They must soon be annexed
to the kingdom of Jesus; and it is high time that the
children of the kingdom should attempt some plan
for their immediate advantage. Ye merchantmen,
who have found the Pearl of great price, to you
another appeal must be made : When will you connect,
with the system of missionary societies, missionary
agents, and missionary presses, that of missionary
ships f
<!-- Leaf 375, Page: 337 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVIII.  
  
  
  JAPAN.

Still farther to the north'is the kingdom or empire
of Japan, which occupies a surface of more than one
hundred and twenty thousand square miles, and
contains a population of about twenty or thirty
millions of souls. It consists of three large islands,
Niphon, Kiusiu, and Sikokf, surrounded by a
multitude of smaller ones, and in the vicinity of others,
stretching northward, over which they exercise a
partial dominion. According to M. M. Brun, "the
whole country is full of mountains and hills, and its
coasts are beset with steep rocks, which are opposed
to the waves of a stormy ocean. The plains are
pervaded by numerous rivers and small streams. The
hills, the mountains, and the plains, present the
interesting picture of human industry amid the traces of
the revolutions of nature. These islands experience,
by turns, the extremes of heat and cold. The summer
heat is frequently alleviated by sea breezes. In
winter the north and north-west winds are
exceedingly sharp, and bring along with them an intense frost.
During the whole year the weather is variable, and  
  
  
  Q
<!-- Leaf 376, Page: 338 -->
much rain falls in the rainy season, whicii begins at
Midsummer. These genial rains conspire with human
labour and manure to overcome the natural sterility
of the soil. Every spot is under cultivation, with
the exception of the most impracticable mountains.
Exempt from feudal and ecclesiastical exactions, the
farmer cultivates the land with zeal and success." In
the hands of such laborious husbandmen, the country
is rendered exceedingly productive. It is said that
the tea shrub grows without culture in the hedges.
Precious metals and minerals also abound.


There are a number of large towns in the empire,
some of which contain a population of several
hundred thousands of souls. The Japanese are short
and muscular in form, though graceful in their
actions, and exceedingly polite. The complexion of
the people varies, as in China. The women of
distinction, who are seldom exposed to the sun and air, are
as fair as European ladies : there is, however, very
little beauty among them. " Large heads, short necks,
broad snubby noses, and oblong, small, and sunken
eyes," constitute the features of the majority. The
mode of wearing their hair, and the quantity of oiled
paper in whicii they wrap themselves for their
journeys, render them rather ludicrous objects.


According to some travellers, " the laws of the
country are few, and executed with the utmost rigour,
and without respect of persons; only that the rich,
when found guilty, are allowed to get off by paying
<!-- Leaf 377, Page: 339 -->
pecuniary fines. Delinquencies of trifling magnitude
are punished with death. The moral education of
the children being a political duty, parents are
rendered accountable for the crimes of those whose early
vices they ought to have repressed. In each village
there is a place surrounded by palisades, containing
in the middle an inscription, in large characters,
consisting of a code of police regulations. The
punishments in the seventeenth century were marked by
the utmost cruelty. Hacking criminals to pieces—
opening their bodies with a knife—suspending them
by iron hooks in their sides—or throwing them into
boiling oil—were common modes of execution. As
in many other unchristianized nations, one is made
responsible for the offences of another; and families,
and entire villages, are visited with the extremity of
punishment for the fault of an individual."


The language of Japan is distinct from that of China,
though the educated class understand the Chinese
character, and read books in that language. Their
own is alphabetic, apparently made up of distinct
parts of the complicated signs employed in China.


There are two religious sects in this country, that
of Sinto, and the followers of Budha. " The first
acknowledges a Supreme Being; but imagines that he
is too exalted to receive the homage of men, or to
have a regard for their petty interests. A large
metalic mirror is placed in the middle of their temples,
to remind the worshippers, that, as every spot on the  
  
  
  oA
<!-- Leaf 378, Page: 340 -->
body is there faithfully represented, the faults of the
soul are seen with equal clearness by the eyes of the
Immortals. The feasts and ceremonies of their
worship are agreeable and cheerful, because they consider
their deities as beings who take pleasure in dispensing
happiness. Budhism here is said to be so mixed
with the Sinto, or old religion of Japan, that it is
difficult, and perhaps will become in time impossible,
to make any discrimination between the votaries of
the two."


The Jesuits, and other Romish orders, made trial
for nearly a century to propagate their faith in Japan.
As early as 1549, they commenced their proselyting
operations in this remote part of the world. Their
early success stimulated them to great attempts;
several governors and tributary kings openly professed
Catholicism; and in one district the Jesuits obtained
the entire prohibition of every other religion. But
their triumph was short. A persecution, almost as
barbarous and bloody as some of their own,
commenced, and raged with such fury that tens of
thousands were massacred; their faith was expunged, and
their very name made a term of infamy to this day.
The distresses they endured are ascribed to various
causes : the political intrigues of the Jesuits, and
other measures suggested by a presumptuous
confidence in their own influence, are among the most
probable reasons. Some affirm that the captain of a
Portuguese vessel, which was taken by the Japanese,
<!-- Leaf 379, Page: 341 -->
represented the missionaries as minions of the
Portuguese Government, sent to prepare the way for
their conquests. Others suppose that something ought
to be attributed to the commercial jealousy of the
Dutch, but upon what ground this allegation is
made we are not informed.


Our usual inquiry has yet to be made, What can
be done for the salvation of this kingdom ?
Notwithstanding all the rigour of their exclusive laws,
merchants trade along their coasts, and come in contact
with great numbers of the natives, among whom the
bread of life might be distributed, and perhaps the
living teacher reside.


The following statements are extracted from the
journals of captains who felt an interest in the
propagation of Christianity, and who wrote to the late
Editor of the Indo-Chinese Gleaner on the subject.
The ship from whose voyage the first statement is
taken, had been lying at Nangasaki, in the island of
Kiusiu, the only place in which foreign vessels are
allowed by law to anchor. Even this limited privilege
is at present confined to the Dutch and Chinese
nations. " After quitting Nangasaki, they landed
occasionally at the villages on the coast, and were
courteously received by the inhabitants, who were very
numerous, and poor, with large families of children."
They describe Jesso, one of the islands alluded to, and
situated north of Niphon, as extensive, and inhabited
by a mild and inoffensive race of men. They are
<!-- Leaf 380, Page: 342 -->
subject to the Japanese, who have a large city on the
south coast ofthe island, and are, no doubt according
to instructions, averse to intercourse with foreigners.
\"The Sagalien peninsula is situated immediately to
the north of Jesso, from whence it is distant, in one
part, but a few miles. The middle districts of the
islands are yet in the possession ofthe natives, with
whom, no doubt, a missionary might reside in as
much security as among more civilized nations.
Perhaps the best expedient which could be adopted to
plant a mission among them, would be to ask
permission at one place; and, if refused, to proceed to
another, and another, until every one is tried which
held forth the probability of success; and then, if
the application is rejected by all, to land and stay
without leave."


Another captain, who visited the famous capital of
Jeddo, or Iedo, and who applied for permission to
trade, gives a most interesting account of the place
and its inhabitants. They were obliged to land their
arms and ammunition, dismantle the ship, and
submit to the closest possible surveillance. " At first
our visitors were too numerous, and constant; but after
the first day strangers were kept from us, and not
even allowed to come afloat; however, the shore was
daily crowded with spectators, a very great majority
of whom were females." " On the fourth day I was
gratified by a visit from two interpreters, one of whom
was a perfect master ofthe Dutch language, and the
<!-- Leaf 381, Page: 343 -->
other knew something of Russian; each could speak
a little English." Their inquiries manifested
considerable acquaintance with the world, and especially
with its politics. Russia, France, England, and
Holland, were all subjects of conversation and
inquiry. After their application to trade was, as usual,
refused, every thing was returned to the ship, and
she was towed out of the bay by about thirty boats.
\"Expressing the hope," continues the Captain, " that
I might be allowed to leave with the interpreters
some trifling remembrance, they answered, that the
laws of the empire were so strict that they could not
receive any thing whatever. I believe that all parties
regretted the circumstances under which we were
quitting each other. The shore was not only thronged
with spectators, but many hundreds came by water
to the neighbouring shores, to gratify their curiosity
by a sight of the strange vessel. We were scarcely
quitted by the tow-boats, when some of these persons
approached very near, and at length accepted our
invitation to come on board. Our decks were soon
thronged in such a manner that I was glad to see a
guard-boat pull towards us for the purpose of
dispersing the crowd, by whom it was no sooner
recognised than they fled in every direction : however,
many quickly returned; and when we would point
out a guard-boat afterwards, some would merely
laugh, and say that they did not care for it; whilst
at other times they would quit, and give us to
<!-- Leaf 382, Page: 344 -->
understand that they were afraid of being destroyed. In
the course of that day and the following we had not
less than two thousand persons on board, all of whom
were eager to barter for trifles. Among other things,
I had the pleasure of obtaining some little books,
and other specimens of the language, and distributing
amongst our visitors two copies of the Chinese New
Testament, together with some tracts written in
Chinese, which language appears to be pretty generally
understood in Japan. If inclined to set any value
on ideas which can be formed concerning the hearts
of men, especially of men so accustomed to disguise
their feelings as we are informed the Japanese are,
I would say, with much confidence, that our dismissal
was universally regretted."


Here we have the same modes of benefiting this
nation suggested, which have been so successfully
employed by recent missionaries in China. The one is,
acting against their cobweb prohibitions, where their
salvation is concerned; and the other, freely
distributing religious books among them. A third mode has
been mentioned, in which the missionaries fully
concur, and that is, to go among them—if you can, with
their permission; if not, without it—and to make the
important experiment, whether our fears and their
vetoes necessarily interfere with our duty and their
eternal happiness. When a nation's laws are opposed
to the laws and the glory of the King of kings, which
must be set aside ? If our object was the extension
<!-- Leaf 383, Page: 345 -->
of an earthly kingdom, there might be some doubts
whether we ought to disregard the regulations of an
empire; but as long as those whom we oppose are
opposed to the Sovereign of heaven and earth, to
their own happiness, and to the best interests of the
universe, we may dismiss all apprehensions, while we
look simply at the command, " Go ye into all the
world, and preach the Gospel to every creature *."
Besides, the policy of kings in this case is as
obnoxious to the wishes of their subjects as it is fatal
to their welfare. We find that at Japan, the Loo
Choo islands, and China, the people are favourable to
a free intercourse with other nations. Let ships, then,
be sent forth with such articles of traffic as may be
useful to the heathen, accompanied by missionaries
and physicians, who can benefit their souls and
bodies, and who will go in and dwell among them.

  CHAPTER XIX.  
  
  
  CONCLUSION.

In conclusion, the writer would ask forgiveness—if it
be a fault—for having wandered so far from the route
of his journeyings. His object has not been simply
that of a traveller. He was sent forth, as a
"messenger of the churches," to learn the condition of
those kingdoms and islands, which, belonging to the
Saviour, the church is commanded in the name of
her Sovereign to occupy. Whatever may be the
impressions produced upon the minds of the Christian
public by reading the accounts here
collected—however difficult and discouraging the accomplishment
of the duty may appear—still their obligations
remain imperative, the command oftheir Saviour
unrevoked, and the condition of the vast majority of their
race inexpressibly wretched. The talent by which they
might effect a world's salvation has been " laid up in
a napkin," until men have forgotten that it was ever
entrusted to them. This talent they are now called
upon to exercise. The slumbers of ages have been
broken, the dreams of God's people dissipated, and
the overpowering conviction begins to flash upon every
<!-- Leaf 385, Page: 347 -->
candid mind, that there are sufficient means in the
possession of Christians to convert all nations, and
that, probably, long before the close of the present
century. Of course we speak with a reference to the
self-multiplying nature of our agency; and still more
to the exercise of that Almighty Power on which alone
we depend, and which we believe would attend it.


These means are diffused among all Christians,
though in unequal proportions; so that he who does
nothing in this work cannot be guiltless, whatever
may be his circumstances, or his sentiments. From
the command of God's word, and the history of many
past centuries, we conclude that much more must
be done than has ever been attempted, or even thought
practicable. The minds of Christians must be
enlightened on this subject—their hearts enlarged—
their purses opened—their energies and influence
combined. No longer must vve sing with deceitful
lips,  
  
  
  "All that I am, and all I have,  
  
  
  Shall be for ever thine;  
  
  
  Whate'er my duty bids me give,

My cheerful hands resign."

No longer must we believe ourselves Christians, and
yet disregard the unequivocal declaration and express
command, " Ye are not your own, for ye are bought
with a price: therefore glorify God in your body and
in your spirit, which are God's *."  
  
  
  * 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20.
<!-- Leaf 386, Page: 348 -->

The reproach of eighteen centuries must be wiped
away from the sacred office ofthe ministry, that " all
seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
Christ's*." With a world before us, and the
prospect of the greatest usefulness in its most distant,
desolate corner, no man must imagine himself
guiltless in any other place. While the claims of other
countries are as powerful as those of England and
America, and the command of Jesus is irrespective of
places, we must either shew that England and
America are no better supplied than those divisions of
the world, or that they ought to be so; or we must
prove that we are released from a universal command
—that we have a dispensation to remain at home.
We do not wish to imply that there is no work, of the
most important kind, to be done at home—we believe
that the "single eye," turn it which way you will,
beholds but one object. The respective interests of
the domestic and foreign fields by no means clash;
their interests are identical. Still there appears to
be a conflict, and one whose din is too loud not to be
distinctly heard. Whence, then, its origin, and where
its seat? May it not be, is it not, between the
dictates of a half-sanctified inclination, and the demand
ofa half-suppressed conscience? We magnify what
our judgment convinces us is comparatively small—
we wish to believe of invisible dimensions what we
must close our eyes not to behold.  
  
  
  •Phil. ii. 21.
<!-- Leaf 387, Page: 349 -->

Let the zeal of the infatuated Jesuits shame us into
action. Their native land and its antipodes were alike
to them. " After my return to Europe," said one of
their Chinese missionaries, " when my intention of
seeking labourers for this vineyard was divulged,
immediately there were so many candidates, that there
is scarce a province of our society from which I have
not received many letters, from several fathers, not
only offering themselves, but earnestly requesting me
to accept of them, as soldiers in this enterprise; as if
the trouble and pains of these long and dangerous
voyages, and the persecutions so certainly to be
undergone, were as nothing to this undertaking. In
Portugal, from the two colleges of Coimbra and Ebora
alone, I had a list of ninety persons, so desirous to
labour in this mission, that many of them have sent
me very long letters, all written and signed with their
own blood, witnessing in this manner that they had
a holy courage that could despise the threats of
martyrdom; offering cheerfully to the Lord that little
blood, as a testimony of the great desire they had to
shed it all for His sake*."


Are there no ministers of the sanctuary whose
usefulness would be greatly increased by leaving their
people and their country, and following in the steps
of these blinded men? How many, alas ! are content


* Samedo's History of China, quoted in the Chinese Repository,
vol.i. page 487.
<!-- Leaf 388, Page: 350 -->
with a limited sphere of labour, when kingdoms and
empires lie in utter destitution ! Energies are
exhausted upon trifles, talents are buried; and men who
might be exceedingly useful are voluntarily
incarcerated. Those who are commanded " to proclaim
liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison
to them that are bound," must have this message first
proclaimed to themselves. The missionary work
demands the most exalted talent and extensive
learning; and, consequently, the arguments employed for
remaining at home, are the very ones which render
more imperative the duty of going abroad. It is true
that the work can accommodate itself to every order
of talent and acquirement—and so can the highest
stations in Christian lands; but the result in both
cases will be alike. The duty of acquiring languages,
translating, writing, instructing on all subjects,
answering all questions, reasoning, devising facilities,
managing events, in many cases practising medicine,
and preaching to different classes, often in different
languages, will soon convince those who make the
trial, that none can be too well qualified for labours
among the heathen. We speak not to discourage
any, but to correct the opinions of some. None need
despair of usefulness—all who feel constrained by the
love of Christ should enlist in this service;—but the
last objection which ought to be conceived, is, that
the minds of any are so vigorous and richly furnished,
<!-- Leaf 389, Page: 351 -->
that the most difficult project of earth, opposed by
all the forces of hell, is not sufficient to employ their
powers.


And why is it that so few of our theological
students engage in foreign missions ? How is it that
such numbers never prayerfully agitate the question
of duty on this subject?—never imagine that they
might possibly be more useful where millions have no
teacher, than where hundreds are ready to occupy the
places at which they usually aim ? After all their
arguments on the advantages of concentrated effort, to
which we subscribe; and with all the growing
demands of our own country, the supply of whicii will
no doubt hasten the universal triumph ofthe Gospel;
do they not know, is it not the opinion of all in
whose judgment they have the greatest confidence,
that those who go abroad increase, instead of
diminishing, the effective agency at home ? The spirit
and the influence of the missionary are among the
most powerful means of awakening the churches, and
directing the attention ofthe young to her highest
offices. Even the infant's mind is arrested by
missionary efforts, and thus pre-occupied by feelings
which in many cases controul its future life.


We look with peculiar interest to the young men in
the theological seminaries. We hear of numbers who
enter these schools under the solemn conviction that it
is their duty to devote their lives to the heathen : their
friends, their fellow-students, the churches, often
<!-- Leaf 390, Page: 352 -->
regard them as virtually set apart to the work : they
are commended for their zeal—their example is
employed in stimulating others to high and
selfdenying efforts;—but, alas ! before they close their
preparatory studies, when the hour of decision for
action has come, the hearts which glowed with so much
ardour have sunk into apathy—the cries of the
perishing are no longer heard, and the subject of missions
is dismissed, as though their obligations were
cancelled, the world Christianized. And whence this
leaving of their first love? What influence exists in
the seminaries, which proves so fatal to the hopes of
God's people and the happiness of his creatures ?


One cause has been assigned, which vve shudder
to contemplate. It is said, that, in some seminaries,
those who retain their zeal in the cause of missions
are classed by their aspiring fellows among the good
men—in other words, men of an inferior order of
intellect;—and to escape the imputation of ordinary
powers, even as combined with elevated piety, many
are tempted to withdraw themselves from their
lessdistinguished brethren. God grant, for His own honour
and the welfare ofthe churches, that this sentiment,
which breathes so much of the spirit of its inspirer,
may alarm every mind which it enters! With
whomsoever this sentiment exists, we cannot but fear that
such servants are above their Master. They must
either believe that the very command under which they
themselves profess to be preparing for the ministry,
<!-- Leaf 391, Page: 353 -->
is not true; or that Christ has devolved the most
difficult and important concerns of his kingdom upon the
feeblest instruments; or else they ought to perceive
that they are indisposed to comply with duty solely
because it is arduous and self-denying.


The fact we have stated with respect to the change
of mind, or rather of feeling, in students, exists, we
fear, in all theological schools; the reason assigned,
we hope, is limited to a very few. What other cause,
then, may produce this paralyzing effect? Is there
nothing to be attributed to the influence of Professors?
We have not heard that any are opposed to foreign
missions : we know that the talents and influence
of many are consecrated to this cause : still, is it not
evident, that either the demands of our own country
(we speak not of our Western missionary field) must
be exhibited in seminaries as superior to those of
heathen nations, or else that there must be a great
declension in the piety of those students who change
their purpose without the least change of
judgment? With the highest opinion of extensive and
varied attainments, when sanctified, still we fully
believe that the salvation of the world depends
infinitely more upon the right principles of the heart,
than upon any training and furnishing of intellect, in
which our venerable Professors may assist. The
difference is this: Piety—we must not confound it
with a morbid, spurious seeling of that name—piety
will stimulate to all efforts, including the culture of
<!-- Leaf 392, Page: 354 -->
the mind; whereas intellect, of any character, engaged
in the ministry, and not directed by its proper spirit,
has generally proved of no permanent advantage to
mankind. We sympathize with those who have
been called to the responsible duty of preparing the
leaders of God's people for their high stations; and
earnestly pray, as the churches should pray, that all
who have such an important direction in the spiritual
concerns of the world, may be under the especial
guidance of the Holy Spirit.


One request we would make of each student,
before leaving this subject—that he would set apart at
least one entire day, in each year of his course, to
ascertain by prayer and fasting whether it is his duty
to remain in the bosom of the church, or to extend
her rich blessings to those who cannot otherwise enjoy
them, and who must perish without them. Place
yourself in imagination before the throne of the Judge;
gather around you that part of the great assembly
whom you might influence through direct efforts, or
an intermediate agency; and, impressed with all the
solemnities of that day, let the question of your duty
be determined; and so determined that you shall not
be confounded when the judgment scene is really
present. Multitudes appear to take it for granted that
they must remain at home, without examining the
subject. Whatever may be their specific object in
entering the ministry, we beg them to consider,
whether it may not be better gained by the influence they
<!-- Leaf 393, Page: 355 -->
may exert abroad, and from abroad, than by
remaining in their native country.


But the work of evangelizing the world demands
more than the labours of the ordained missionary.
There must be teachers, physicians, merchants, and
in some places mechanics—Christian communities,
who can employ all the various means by which the
heathen may be influenced, and at the same time
exhibit to them an example of the blessedness in
which they labour to make them participate. The
advantage of sending colonies, and not merely
missionaries, is obvious to all who have been abroad.
The work would advance in proportion to the variety
of plans adopted, and the number of instruments
employed. Commerce and medicine harmonize
admirably with schools, the press, distribution, and
preaching. And if native agency is to be efficiently
engaged in the missionary work, it can never be
prepared with the same facility and perfection as in
colonies of this description. Besides, labour and
expense would be greatly economized. Those
numerous domestic duties, which consume so much of
the time of single missionaries, or families, might be
devolved upon a few; while the majority of both
sexes would be at liberty to labour exclusively for the
heathen.


Of the hundreds of physicians who take their
diplomas every year, are there none with the vows of
God upon them ? none, who will unite in a work so
<!-- Leaf 394, Page: 356 -->
glorious, and where their services are so greatly
needed ? In many stations they can accomplish more
than ordained missionaries. They have the best
passport to the dwellings and hearts of the heathen;
they possess a magnet which would attract crowds,
and reach to places where we can never penetrate.
While they can accomplish the most important part
ofa missionary's duties, they can do it under much
greater advantages than those who have not their
knowledge. Patients feel themselves under
obligations, and are disposed to comply with any methods
which may be devised for their spiritual benefit.
Congregations have been thus formed, books widely
distributed, instrumentality increased, and souls
saved; besides, the perishing have been rescued from
death, the suffering relieved, and the hearts of those
who would have been widowed and fatherless, made
to sing for joy.


Every argument which can be addressed to others,
applies to physicians; while they have but few of the
reasons for refusing, which ministers and students
generally offer. They do not usually remain at home
from a sense of duty; they find it exceedingly
difficult to obtain situations and patronage. Their
services may be generally dispensed with, or performed
by others who would gladly become their substitutes.
What, then, should prevent numbers from discharging
this important and imperative duty ? How can they
deliver their skirts from the blood of souls, if they
<!-- Leaf 395, Page: 357 -->
refuse? If their education have been extensive—if
they possess much skill and experience—the more are
they needed, where so much may depend upon their
success. The writer had an application for medical
aid from the second King of Siam: he was absent
at the time, and did not return until after the death
of the King. How readily might a simple effort in
such instances lead to the most desirable results !


Merchants, also, are capable of exerting the most
salutary influence among Pagan nations. They, too,
like physicians, usually draw multitudes around them,
who might be instructed both orally and by books.
Besides this, they would stimulate to labour, by
opening a current for its proceeds. They would improve
the habits of the natives, by introducing the useful
arts and meliorating customs of civilized life. They
would commend their religion, by exemplifying its
principles in all their ordinary pursuits. The
connexions which they might establish, and the
obligations which they could impose, might be employed for
the spiritual welfare of multitudes. Are there none
who possess the means of trade, disposed to embark
their capital in such a cause ? Are there none, whose
engagements are not so necessary to themselves, nor
so sufficiently available to the great objects of
benevolence, as to prevent them from leaving their country ?
The churches can. furnish numbers unencumbered
with domestic cares, or, if married, without families :
what should prevent such from engaging in this, or
<!-- Leaf 396, Page: 358 -->
other useful employments, when they have nothing
to keep them at home, and many of them need not
depend upon the Christian public for support ? When
will the days of primitive Christianity return, when
every Christian shall consider his possessions as the
church's property, and himself as a servant of all!


The co-operation and influence of ladies are also
greatly needed in evangelizing the heathen. In many
countries they alone have access to their own sex.
The only Christian lady who ever resided at Siam was
admitted within the palace walls, and among the
numerous wives of the princes and chief men of the
country. Infant schools and female schools are their
department; and none can succeed as well as they in
obtaining scholars, and instructing and advising
mothers. Ladies ought to accompany every mission
family. The appeal to them is peculiarly affecting:
it is the language of the oppressed and miserable—
the united voice of more than one half of their sex.
The simple controul of mothers over children is
enough to shew how much the happiness and moral
habits of a nation depend upon the elevation of
females. Let this subject, then, enter into the prayers
and efforts of Christian ladies, and such measures be
devised, and such teachers sent forth, as shall change
the condition of the sex, and place them in the sphere
which, in mercy to the world as well as to themselves,
they were designed to occupy.  
  
  
  There is still another class in society, who, if we
<!-- Leaf 397, Page: 359 -->
can judge from external circumstances of Providence,
are laid under peculiar obligations to devote
themselves to this work. There are men of property, who
are engaged in no business, and who have no peculiar
obstacles to such an undertaking, whose presence,
counsels, prayers, and funds, would greatly redound
to their Saviour's glory in heathen lands. What
hinders such from employing themselves, and the
important talent committed to them, in benefiting a
world ? Has their wealth wholly, or even partially,
released them from the obligation of glorifying God to
the utmost of their ability ? Has a man born to a
fortune, or successful in acquiring one,any greater liberty
to consult his own pleasure in the disposal of himself
and his property, than another? "What has he, that
he has not received ? * " and what has he received
which he is not bound " to minister according to the
ability which God has given him; that God in all
things may be glorified, through Jesus Christ?*!* "


But, without specifying other classes in society,
we would inquire of all whom God has sanctified to
Himself, have you prayerfully contemplated the
obligations under which you lie, to advance the great
design which brought the Saviour from His throne,
and for which He now reigns? If you have lived in
neglect of this duty before, ascend now some eminence
which commands the world—gaze upon the scene of
desolation and misery, which spreads on every side—  
  
  
  *1 Cor. iv. 7. t 1 Peti iv. 11.
<!-- Leaf 398, Page: 360 -->
hear the appeals for help, from a thousand millions of
souls, multiplying and perishing every hour; and then,
with the first prayer of Paul upon your lips, build an
altar to Jehovah-Sabaoth, and offer upon it
"yourselves a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service*." With such a
spirit and such an offering, the path of duty will be
made plain.


To those who feel themselves under obligations to
remain at home; who have the evidence of an
enlightened conscience and a directing providence in favour
of their present lot; we must still look for most
valuable services in the kingdom of Christ. They must
elevate the standard of piety by example and
influence—they must furnish the world with suitable men,
and necessary means—and, above all, they must pray
\"for all men " f " always with all prayer and
supplication in the Spirit "f"


Ye mothers, did you realize your solemn vows and
unalienable obligations to Christ, when you offered
your children to Him at the baptismal font ? He
accepted His own, and returned them, not as yours, but
to be nourished and educated for His service. Yours
is a prominent part in the conversion of the world.
The army which the King of kings and Lord of lords

conquest ofthe nations, He looks to you to replenish.

<!-- Leaf 399, Page: 361 -->
if faithless to your charge ! And oh what happiness
will be diffused in the kingdom of Christ—through
the heaven of heavens—if your vows are paid, your
work performed!


And ye teachers of the young in Infant Schools,
Sabbath Schools, and all the various institutions of
the land, we plead with you, in behalf of the children
committed to your care, and the millions upon whom
they are to exert a saving or destructive influence.
Make their salvation your chief concern, and leave
no means untried for its attainment.


In the name of the Saviour, we ask for the
cooperation of all God's people in hastening His universal
reign. We would plead with the wealthy, the learned,
the eloquent, the influential—all who can act—all
who can pray. When every Christian lives for the
conversion of the world, he will be discharging his
duty, and the world shall soon be saved. Oh that
He, with whom is the promise and the power;
without whom agents cannot be qualified, nor agency
successful; would soon raise up such men and
suggest such measures, as His Spirit may employ in
subduing the world to Himself!

  CHAPTER XX.  
  
  
  VOYAGE TO EUROPE.

After leaving the coast of Borneo, where the reader
had the last glimpse of the ship, we passed through
the Straits of Sunda, and on the night ofthe 16th of
August made the memorable island of St. Helena.
Early on the morning ofthe 17th, we found ourselves
within a few miles of its shore. It is difficult to
conceive any thing more rugged and inhospitable than
its aspect from this approach : not a tree, scarcely a
tuft of grass, could be discerned. A flag-staff or
two, a few small batteries and soldiers' lodgings, were
all that indicated the presence of man. The rocks,
running below in perpendicular strata, and above in
horizontal, had a curious appearance. As we
approached the side of the island, the hand of man
became more visible. We were hailed from a
rockperched fort, and ordered to send a boat on shore.
This command, however, was not enforced upon
hearing "All's well." About seven a.m. we opened
James' Valley and Town, and anchored. Here the
scene changed. The town, crowded into the fissure of
lofty hills, which seemed torn asunder for the purpose
<!-- Leaf 401, Page: 363 -->
—the forts and dwellings and telegraphs scattered
over their sides and summits—the laboured and
winding roads leading up their steep acclivities—the
detached pieces of ordnance, pointing from the tops
of the rocks—as well as the trees and shrubbery,
generally brought from other climes, and giving a
scanty clothing to some ofthe elevations—proclaimed
the triumph of human intellect and art over the most
insurmountable obstacles of nature.


As a matter of course, we visited Buonaparte's
tomb. An order from the Governor admits you
within the enclosure, and entitles you to the attentions
and tale of the old guard, and to a branch or two of
the overhanging willows. The tomb is composed of
three granite slabs, placed longitudinally over the
body. An iron grating surrounds it. Thoughts of
human grandeur and insignificance, with the high
and awful considerations of eternity, follow in rapid
succession, as you tread over the mouldering relics
of the hero. The struggle of a giant for the universe,
of an insect for its microscopic kingdom, have the
same finale. Though " this is the man that made the
earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms," yet
the meanest slaves that have ever left their ignoble
dust upon the island, may address him in the sublime
strains of the prophet *—" Art thou also become
weak as we? art thou become like unto us?...How  
  
  
  *Isai. xiv. 10—12.
<!-- Leaf 402, Page: 364 -->
art thou fallen from heaven, O greater than Lucifer*,
son ofthe morning! how art thou cut down to the
ground, which didst weaken the nations !...The
worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee."
But there is another and more important sense in
which this equality may be claimed by all from all.
Low and ephemeral indeed are the envied distinctions
of earth, when compared with the bright, unfading
glories of a future world. To pass from the highest
honours of life into "shame and everlasting
contempt," how awful!—to awaken from the deepest
obscurity, to the dignity of sons of God, how
sublime !


We visited Longwood—now a stable, and at best
a mean, contracted residence. Five rooms, of most
straitened dimensions, were all the apartments allotted
him who before had controuled a greater number of
kingdoms.


Such a variety of scenery as burst upon the view
from every elevated position of this romantic island, is
seldom to be found within the same compass. The
situations for country-seats, which adorn the uneven
face of the high land, are well selected, and some
spots are in beautiful cultivation. Blooming valleys
and sterile hills arrest the eye at one turn, and
smiling hills and barren vales at another. And what
is more sublime than all, is the vast expanse of
ocean which this elevation commands, with its varied  
  
  
  * King of Babylon : see verse 4.
<!-- Leaf 403, Page: 365 -->
lights and shades, spreading in boundless perspective,
and losing itself high in the distant heavens.


There are two churches, and two chaplains on
the island. Our stay was too short to admit of
forming many acquaintances. I was happy in being
introduced to two or three persons who evinced
the spirit of genuine piety, and my short visit was
much cheered by the very kind and hospitable
attentions received from the American consul, W.
Carroll, Esq.


On the morning of the 18th we weighed anchor,
and, after encountering a terrific gale off the Western
Islands, in which the rudder-head gave way, arrived
in England in the middle, of October, after a passage
of five months.


For the restoration of health, and in prosecution of
his missionary duties, the writer visited various parts
of Great Britain and the Continent. Much interest
was every where awakened in behalf of the heathen,
especially the Ultra-Gangetic nations. All felt that it
was a work which claimed the co-operation of the
Christian world.


\"The unity of the Spirit " was strongly realized
while sojouring among the Christians of Great
Britain, France, Holland, Germany, and
Switzerland. With all the differences of customs, languages,
politics, and sects, " all have been baptized into
one body, and made to drink of one Spirit," and all
agree in the belief that the Saviour looks to his
<!-- Leaf 404, Page: 366 -->
churches for the speedy extension of his kingdom
throughout the world. Oh, when shall wars cease
and those barriers of national and ecclesiastical
separation, which have so long divided brethren, fall,
like the walls of Jericho, and lie under the perpetual
ban of Joshua's great Antitype !
